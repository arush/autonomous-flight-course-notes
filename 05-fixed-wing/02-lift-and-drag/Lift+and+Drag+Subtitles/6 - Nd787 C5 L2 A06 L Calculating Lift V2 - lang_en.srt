1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,609
We have a basic conceptual model for lift,

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,094
and now would like to know how to calculate lift.

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:06,990
The first thing we need to do is bring in

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,509
a concept called the non-dimensional coefficient.

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,900
Calculating the lift of a wing is computationally costly

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,920
and involves integrating the dynamic pressure over every point on the wing.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,860
When people were designing wings in the 20th century,

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,369
it was really expensive to build those models and they needed a way to

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,450
avoid having to recreate the model for a wing in different conditions.

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,050
What you really want is a single number that could predict the force

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,969
produced under a range of conditions like the speed of the vehicle,

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,594
the density of air and the size of the wing.

13
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:42,414
Because you multiply that single number by the relevant dimensions so you get the force,

14
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:45,420
this number is called the non-dimensional coefficient of lift.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,460
We are going to define the total lift force as L equals

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,155
C sub L Qbar S. S is the area of the wing.

17
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,439
That's something that we can calculate based on the geometry of our wing.

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,890
Qbar is the dynamic pressure,

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,570
and that is going to depend on the air speed and the air density.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,159
Specifically, Q bar is 1.5 rho times V squared.

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,709
Rho here is the density of air,

22
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,084
and it's a function of altitude and temperature.

23
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:15,890
There are good models for air density that we can use to look this up.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,060
V is the speed of the aircraft through the air,

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,060
and we can get this either from an air speed sensor or we can

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,439
estimate it using state estimation techniques from other sensors.

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,129
That just leaves the lift coefficient C sub L,

28
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,375
and this is typically a non-linear function of the angle of attack Alpha,

29
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,484
the pitch rate Q and the elevator deflection

30
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:39,185
delta E. This non-linear function is hard to model exactly.

31
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:43,144
So, we'll use a first order tailor series approximation to write

32
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,659
C sub L as C sub L naught plus C sub L

33
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,019
alpha times alpha plus C sub L delta E times delta

34
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,879
E. This first term is the coefficient of lift at zero angle of attack.

35
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,474
This next term is the lift slope and it tells us how lift changes with angle of attack.

36
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:05,689
This last term is the dimensionless control derivative and

37
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,974
it tells us how lift changes with elevator deflection.

38
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,479
Note that this model assumes low angles of attack,

39
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,649
small elevator deflection and zero pitch rate.

40
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,469
It's important to remember that every part of the aircraft generate some lift.

41
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:22,240
The fuselage and the horizontal tail generate lift, for example.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,365
For small aircraft, we can generally ignore these contributions,

43
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,640
but for bigger flying car that's actually carrying people,

44
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,359
it would be better to model each of these separately.
