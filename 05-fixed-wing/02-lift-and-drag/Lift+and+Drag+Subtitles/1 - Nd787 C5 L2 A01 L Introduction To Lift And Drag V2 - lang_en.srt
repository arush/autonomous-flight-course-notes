00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Welcome back. To understand how to control a fixed-wing aircraft,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,520
we need a better understanding of

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,234
the underlying Physics than we needed when controlling a quadrotor.

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:12,629
If you think back to the controls module from the first term,

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,080
you might remember that our model of quadrotor Physics was pretty simple.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,789
The model you used only considered two types of forces,

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,234
the weight of the quadrotor,

8
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:24,989
which I always pointed down in the global frame and the thrust from

9
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,119
each of the four propellers each of which always points up in the body frame.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,039
What about fixed-wing vehicles?

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,549
Let's consider a plane flying in straight and level flight at constant speed.

12
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:38,029
This aircraft will experience a weight force from

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,594
gravity which points down in the global frame.

14
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:43,189
It will also experience a thrust force from

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,989
the propulsion system but this points

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,079
forward in the body frame of the aircraft instead of upwards.

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
But the thing that makes fixed-wing dynamics more complex than

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,295
quadrotor dynamics are the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag.

19
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:00,990
Drag is a force that points opposite the direction of motion of the vehicle.

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,980
For this plane traveling in straight and level flight,

21
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,694
drag would point directly behind the vehicle.

22
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:10,344
Lift is generated by the wing as it moves through the air.

23
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:13,950
For this aircraft, lift would point in this direction.

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,790
This lesson is all about understanding and modeling

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,829
these two forces but before we can build a model for these forces,

26
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:24,559
it will help to do a quick review of some of the relevant Physics.
