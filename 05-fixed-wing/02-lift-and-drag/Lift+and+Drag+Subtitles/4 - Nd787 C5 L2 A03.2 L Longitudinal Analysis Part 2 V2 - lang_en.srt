1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
So, what are these three hidden frames of reference?

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,609
First, we have the inertial frame of reference.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,355
You might also see this referred to as the world or global frame.

4
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:13,150
This is just the Northeast down frame you've seen before.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,629
The Z-axis of this frame is parallel to the gravity vector.

6
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:20,164
The X-axis points North and the Y-axis points East,

7
00:00:20,164 --> 00:00:22,119
though we can't see it in this picture.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,179
Next, we have the body frame.

9
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,429
The origin of this frame is at the center of mass of the vehicle.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:32,295
The X-axis points out of the nose and the Z-axis points down through the fuselage.

11
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,380
As you can see, the thrust vector is aligned to the X-axis of this frame.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,650
Finally, we have what's called the stability frame.

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,710
The stability frame is actually determined by the direction of this arrow which,

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,429
remember, is the velocity of the air relative to the plane.

15
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,244
In this example, we're imagining zero wind.

16
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:53,890
So, this vector is just the opposite of the plane's velocity vector,

17
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,174
but you could imagine,

18
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,919
that would change if there were wind.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,804
As you can see, drag points in the negative X direction in the stability frame,

20
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:03,034
and lift points in the negative Z direction.

21
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,539
In addition to these three frames of reference,

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,905
there are three important angles that are used to relate these frames.

23
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,030
If we ignore the forces for a moment,

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,640
what we have is a plane pointed in this direction,

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,805
relative airflow coming in at this direction,

26
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,795
and that this line is horizontal in the inertial frame.

27
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:23,099
The angle between the body frame in horizontal in the inertial frame is Theta.

28
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:24,989
This is the pitch angle of the vehicle.

29
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:27,140
The angle between the airflow and the

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,075
horizontal is the flight path angle and it's labeled Gamma.

31
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:35,715
Finally, the angle between the airflow and the body frame is called the angle of attack,

32
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,625
and it's usually labeled Alpha.

33
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,010
These three angles are useful when you need to

34
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,200
rotate forces into different frames of reference.
