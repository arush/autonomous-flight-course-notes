1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,924
The second major aerodynamic force acting on the vehicle is drag.

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:08,519
Drag always points parallel to the direction of airflow relative to the vehicle,

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,129
which means it acts to resist forward motion.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,160
There are actually two forms of drag.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,839
The first is called parasitic drag and this is

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,519
just the resistance the air puts up against any body moving through it.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,745
The other form of drag is called lift induced drag.

8
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,339
Remember, that when a wing is producing lift

9
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:30,105
the incoming air flows over the top and bottom of the wing at different speeds.

10
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,800
When these flows are joined,

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,695
they tend to get deflected downwards,

12
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,255
this is called downwash.

13
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:36,690
So for this wing,

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,589
we have the relative airflow coming into the wind like this and

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,000
the effective relative airflow leaving the wing like this.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,840
Now, we define lift to be

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,140
the aerodynamic force that's perpendicular to the relative airflow.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,410
So, the lift in this case has to point like this,

19
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,869
but since the effective airflow that the wing sees

20
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:56,274
is actually rotated by this downwash angle,

21
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:59,769
the effective lift will also be rotated by the same amount.

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,710
This rotated effective lift vector has a component that points parallel to

23
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,465
the incoming relative airflow and that component is what we call lift induced drag.

24
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,125
So, when we model drag,

25
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:13,025
we'll model it as some non-dimensional coefficient,

26
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,455
times the dynamic pressure,

27
00:01:14,454 --> 00:01:17,024
times the surface area of the wing.

28
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:20,790
This coefficient will be the sum of two other coefficients.

29
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,525
The first is the coefficient of parasitic drag

30
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,900
and the second is the coefficient of lift induced drag.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,280
This second coefficient is itself a function of the lift coefficient we saw before.
