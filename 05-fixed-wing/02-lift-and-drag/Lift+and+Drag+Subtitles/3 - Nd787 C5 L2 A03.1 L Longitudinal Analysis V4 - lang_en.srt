00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
It'd be a lot easier if I had an actual model airplane to show you

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,640
some of the concepts I'm going to talk about today. Thanks plane fairy.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,355
In some of the previous quizzes,

4
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:13,835
you saw a picture of a plane travelling forward at some constant speed,

5
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,480
and this picture is relatively easy to analyze.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,705
Thrust points forwards, drag points backwards,

7
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,889
weight points down, and lift points up.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,660
When I talk about this plane,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,929
I can use words like up, down, forwards,

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,649
and backwards unambiguously since the axes of the body frame of

11
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,989
the aircraft point in the same direction as

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,385
the axes of the global or inertial frame of reference,

13
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:38,289
but that's not generally true.

14
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:41,089
To keep track of the dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft,

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,635
we actually need multiple frames of reference.

16
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:46,129
When analyzing the longitudinal motion,

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,469
there are three frames that we'll discuss.

18
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,670
We can see the need for each of these reference frames by watching a plane as it lands.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,655
Consider this plane as it approaches the runway to land.

20
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:00,774
Since it's descending, the velocity vector points forwards and downwards.

21
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:04,004
But, when we're analyzing the forces on a plane,

22
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,634
the velocity of the plane,

23
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:06,960
relative to the ground,

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,375
isn't nearly as important as the velocity of the air relative to the plane.

25
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,049
So, if it's a still day and there's zero wind,

26
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,664
then from the plane's point of view,

27
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,975
the airstream will be coming in the opposite direction, like this.

28
00:01:19,974 --> 00:01:22,589
So, we'll call this V sub air.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,000
Note that the aircraft itself will be generally pitched upwards.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,709
The important thing to note here is that the direction of travel is

31
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,034
not the same as the direction that the nose is pointing.

32
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:35,584
Now, let's analyze the forces acting on this plane.

33
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:38,429
We're going to add four more arrows to this diagram.

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,160
Keep in mind that this arrow,

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,489
V sub air, is not a force.

36
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:47,009
It's just there to remind us what direction the air is moving relative to the plane.

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,195
For the first force, we have weight.

38
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,149
Weight is going to point in this direction since

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,380
gravity always points to the center of the Earth.

40
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,009
Next, we have drag.

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,565
Drag always points parallel to the relative airflow,

42
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,325
so it's going to point this way.

43
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:03,710
Next is thrust. The direction of thrust is determined by their propulsion system,

44
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,399
but generally it will be in the same direction that the nose of the plane is pointed in.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,599
So, it might look something like this.

46
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,829
Finally, lift always points perpendicular to incoming airflow,

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,620
so it point in this direction.

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,055
Note that lift does not point normal to the surface of the wings.

49
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,944
Lift and drag are always at right angles to each other.

50
00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:25,938
Now, hidden in these four force vectors and one velocity vector,

51
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,909
are actually three frames of reference that we need to keep track of

52
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,639
when analyzing the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle.
