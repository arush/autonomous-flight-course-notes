1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Up until this point, we've been talking about thrust, weight,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,339
lift, and drag, without really discussing where these forces come from.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,714
Thrust and weight are forces that you should be familiar with.

4
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:15,449
Weight is just the mass of an object times the acceleration due to gravity.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,910
Thrust is what we call the force generated by

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,280
a propulsion system like a propeller or a jet engine.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,955
The details of how these propulsion systems work

8
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:26,559
are something we can safely ignore for our purposes,

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,099
so we can continue to take thrust as a given.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,399
But we will need to know a bit more about lift and drag.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,155
These forces are both aerodynamic forces,

12
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:40,424
which means they come from the relative motion between a body like a plane and the air.

13
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:41,989
Let's start with lift.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,800
The key concept is what's called "dynamic pressure."

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,599
Dynamic pressure is the pressure caused by the motion of

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,320
a body like a wing through a fluid, like air.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,155
Note that the body doesn't have to be a wing.

18
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:59,560
For example, imagine some rectangular block travelling to the left through the air.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,045
As it moves, the air will exert a pressure everywhere on the block.

20
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,260
Now, some of that pressure comes from the fact

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,270
that the body is actually pushing on the air.

22
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,774
You felt this pressure if you've ever stuck your hand out of the window of a car,

23
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:17,010
but this only explains a small portion of how a wing generates lift.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,980
Here, you can see the cross-section of a wing.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,750
As a wing moves through the air,

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,379
there is smooth or what's called laminar flow over the top and the bottom of the wing.

27
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,664
Due to the shape of the wing,

28
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:33,010
the air will tend to flow faster over the top of the wing and slower over the bottom.

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,260
This faster flowing air has lower pressure

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,704
than the slower moving air on the bottom of the wing.

31
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:41,299
Since pressure is just a force exerted over an area,

32
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,344
lower pressure means less force.

33
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,239
So, this pressure differential between the top and bottom of

34
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,280
the wing means there's actually a net force that points upwards on the wing.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,920
An important thing to note is that this method of generating lift relies on laminar flow,

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,344
but this laminar flow can be disrupted.

37
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:59,989
In general, it's easy to maintain laminar flow when

38
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,324
the angle of attack is low and when maneuvers are gentle.

39
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,710
But when the angle of attack increases beyond a certain threshold,

40
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,924
the flow can become separated from the wing.

41
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,780
In this case, the airflow over the top of the wing becomes

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,534
turbulent and the wings suddenly produces significantly less lift.

43
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,259
This is called "stall."

44
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,389
The mathematical models for lift that we discussed in this module

45
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,599
do not explicitly account for the critical stall angle,

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,840
but an autopilot would need to incorporate that angle into its control decisions.
