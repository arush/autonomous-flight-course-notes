1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
We started this lesson by defining

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,394
the frames of reference for fixed-wing longitudinal motion.

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:09,074
We then looked at the four forces that act on fixed wing vehicles

4
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:13,254
and identified the relevant reference frame and axis for each force.

5
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:14,835
Of these four forces,

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,140
two of them were familiar: weight and thrust.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,594
But, the two aerodynamic forces: lift and drag were just simple.

8
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:25,849
We came up with mathematical models for these forces and the pitching moment,

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,760
M. You were able to use these forces to solve for

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,155
trim states like straight level flight and climbing flight.

11
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:34,550
These trim states are really important.

12
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,989
At the end of this module,

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,804
you'll be asked to implement a controller for fixed-wing flight,

14
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:41,600
and a big part of that controller's job will be to identify

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,130
the appropriate term values for the propulsion system and the control surfaces.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,370
In the next two lessons,

17
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,199
we'll come up with full mathematical models for fixed-wing dynamics.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,050
First for longitudinal motion and then for lateral directional motion.

19
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:56,834
In the last lesson of this module,

20
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:00,240
you'll learn how to implement an autopilot for fixed-wing flight.
