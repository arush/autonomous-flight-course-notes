00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,610
By the end of this lesson,

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,629
you'll be able to use a linear model of

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,234
the longitudinal dynamics of a vehicle to actually answer the questions we just asked.

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,619
The analytical techniques you're going to use are pretty

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,064
straightforward but the math underlying them is not so simple.

6
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:15,605
For the next part of this lesson,

7
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:17,490
I want to give you some intuitive sense for

8
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,695
how that math works without going too deep into the details.

9
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:23,609
Let me sketch out the plan for the rest of this lesson.

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,769
First, I'm going to show you

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,149
a linearized version of the equations of motion you saw earlier.

12
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,699
This linearized version will represent the dynamics of the system near

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,690
a trim state as x dot equals AX plus BU.

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,159
This might look similar to

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,799
the state-transition function you saw when learning about common filters.

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,809
Next, we're going to focus on this square A matrix,

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,730
which is called the stability matrix,

18
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,009
and I'm going to explain how we can decompose

19
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,039
this matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,909
This decomposition will allow us to identify modes in the motion.

21
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:00,069
These modes will have a term that looks something like E raised to

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,719
the A plus BI times T. This A plus BI is called a complex number.

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,359
After that, you'll see how the exponential of a complex number actually leads to motion,

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,655
which is a combination of oscillation with exponential growth or decay.

25
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,349
Finally, we'll put this altogether and

26
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:21,559
actually answer some of the questions we just asked.
