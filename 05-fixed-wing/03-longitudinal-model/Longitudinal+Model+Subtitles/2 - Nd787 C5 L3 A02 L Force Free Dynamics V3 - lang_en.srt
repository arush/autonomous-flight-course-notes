00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
The first step in building our nonlinear longitudinal model,

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,754
is to identify what quantities we need to track.

3
00:00:06,754 --> 00:00:10,039
For now, we're going to take this to be our state vector.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,410
Here, we have the x and z coordinates of the vehicle, in the inertial frame.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,335
Note that, for this lesson,

6
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:21,269
z is positive upwards to make the math a bit more consistent with some other references.

7
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,339
Theta is the pitch angle.

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,899
U and W give the x,

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,929
z velocity in the body frame,

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,295
and Q is the pitch rate in the body frame.

11
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:33,545
This is the same Q from the PQ and R body rates you've worked with earlier.

12
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:38,425
Now, I'd like to quickly derive the equations of motion for the vehicle in two steps.

13
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:41,044
First, we'll consider motion with no forces,

14
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,219
and then we'll consider motion with forces.

15
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,289
Defining the equations of motion means,

16
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,384
figuring out how all the state variables change with time.

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:53,164
The x and z derivatives give the velocity in the initial frame. They look like this.

18
00:00:53,164 --> 00:00:55,594
They are just the velocity in the body frame,

19
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:57,414
rotated by the pitch angle.

20
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,960
Theta dot is just the pitch rate Q.

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,620
The last three derivatives look like this.

22
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,030
Q dot is zero,

23
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,810
because there are no moments on the vehicle for now.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,780
Since there are no forces,

25
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,224
you might expect U and W dot to be zero.

26
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:13,939
But if the vehicle is moving in the inertial frame with some velocity as it rotates,

27
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:18,120
then the body frame velocities will not be the same from time-step to time-step.
