1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,674
The eigenvectors of the stability matrix describe the "modes" of the system.

2
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:07,540
So, if the initial state of the system has some eigenvector Vi,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,919
then the motion will be along the line spanned by Vi,

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,855
and the motion as a function of time looks like this.

5
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:19,024
The Lambda i in this equation is just the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector Vi.

6
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,445
When we analyze this stability matrix,

7
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,120
we're often analyzing these eigenvalues since

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,130
this complex exponential e to

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,769
the Lambda it actually tells us a lot about the motion of the vehicle.

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,710
As you just saw, this Lambda will,

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,664
in general, be a complex number,

12
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,289
a plus b times i.

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,515
This a is referred to as the real part of the eigenvalue and the b is the imaginary part.

14
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:46,009
A complex exponential describes motion that is some combination of

15
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,814
oscillation along with exponential growth or decay.

16
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:52,780
When the real part of the eigenvalue is negative,

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,965
the motion for the corresponding mode will be stable.

18
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:59,865
Which means that when the system is perturbed from the trim state,

19
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:02,530
it will eventually return to the trim state.

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,430
When the real part of the eigenvalue is positive,

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,315
the motion for the corresponding mode is unstable.

22
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:13,375
Which means that small deviations from trim will tend to grow with time.

23
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,290
So, when the real parts of all of the eigenvalues are negative,

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,484
the system will be stable overall.

25
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,144
For a flying vehicle,

26
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,179
this means that the aircraft will always

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,490
want to return to trim after it's been disturbed.

28
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,920
For example, by a gust of wind.
