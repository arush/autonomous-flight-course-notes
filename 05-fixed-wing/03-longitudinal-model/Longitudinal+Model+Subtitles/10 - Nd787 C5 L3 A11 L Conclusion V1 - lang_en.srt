1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
We begin this lesson by looking at

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,264
the nonlinear equations of motion for the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle,

3
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:10,750
and we use these equations to simulate the state of a vehicle forward in time.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,679
When the aircraft is in initial state that's close

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,289
to but not exactly equal to a trim state,

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,109
you saw that its motion does some surprising things.

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,169
We wanted to know where this weird behavior came from,

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,700
but realized we couldn't really do much to analyze the nonlinear equations of motion.

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,059
So, we linearized the dynamics around the trim state and

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,570
found that the eigenvalues told us a lot about the motion of the vehicle.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,420
In particular, we found

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,530
four interesting eigenvalues which came as two complex conjugate pairs.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,219
Both of these pairs had negative real parts which meant that they were stable,

14
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,609
but their non-zero imaginary parts meant that they were also oscillatory.

15
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:50,335
These motion modes are well-known phenomena.

16
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,509
We call the faster mode the short-period response,

17
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,549
and the slower mode is called phugoid.

18
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,789
Trying to fight these natural modes of motion can be tricky,

19
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,119
and you'll learn more about fixed-wing control and autopilots after the next lesson.

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,509
In the next lesson, we'll analyze a lateral directional dynamics of

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,440
a fixed-wing vehicle using a similar approach to what we used here.
