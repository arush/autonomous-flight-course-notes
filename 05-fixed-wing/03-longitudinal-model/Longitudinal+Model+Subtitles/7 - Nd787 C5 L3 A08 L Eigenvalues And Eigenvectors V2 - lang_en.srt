1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,325
We need to analyze the square stability matrix to understand the motion near trim.

2
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:06,625
To do this analysis,

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:10,740
we're going to need to remind ourselves of what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,780
Any square matrix can be represented as a product of three matrices like this.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,009
This uppercase Lambda is a diagonal matrix with

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,335
numbers along the diagonal and zeros everywhere else.

7
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:25,820
This V matrix is a matrix of column vectors,

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,594
where each column can be associated with one of the numbers in Lambda.

9
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:34,789
We label each of the numbers in this uppercase Lambda matrix with a lowercase Lambda.

10
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,670
So we have Lambda one, Lambda two,

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,375
and so on, and these Lambdas are the eigenvalues of our original matrix.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,469
If we have some eigenvalue Lambda i,

13
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,293
the corresponding column vector Vi is called an eigenvector.

14
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:52,904
These eigenvalues and eigenvectors have interesting properties.

15
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:58,195
For example, if the initial state of the system is some eigenvector Vi,

16
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:02,905
then A times V i will be equal to Lambda i times vi,

17
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:07,579
and the motion as a function of time will be given by x of t is equal

18
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,569
to e to Lambda i times t times the eigenvector Vi.

19
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,169
It isn't essential that you understand all the math behind this equation.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,150
The important thing to note is that we now have

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,219
an actual equation for the state as a function of time.

22
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,814
This means that if we know the initial state of the system,

23
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:31,340
we can actually predict the state of the system at

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,990
any time in the future using just this equation in a single step.

25
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:40,609
That was something we couldn't do with the nonlinear equations.

26
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:45,504
With those equations, we had to actually simulate the dynamics at each time step.

27
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:50,879
So, let's look at this equation and focus on this e to the Lambda t term.

28
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,789
One thing I didn't mention about

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,844
these eigenvalues is that they are actually complex numbers.

30
00:01:56,844 --> 00:02:00,400
A complex number can be written as a plus bi.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,390
This i is the imaginary number defined as the square root of minus one.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,094
You might also see it written as j.

33
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,060
So when we take e to the Lambda times t,

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,275
we are really taking e to the a plus bi times t,

35
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:19,120
and this complex exponential has some interesting properties that you'll explore now.
