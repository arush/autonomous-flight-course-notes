1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,380
Building an effective flying car requires using

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,339
a hybrid design that takes advantage of the strengths of each.

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,560
Before you can design a hybrid vehicles,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,594
it's important to first understand how purely fixed-wing vehicles work.

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:22,074
In this lesson, you were introduced to the various components of these vehicles.

7
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:25,609
In particular the wings and the various control surfaces.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,769
In the next lesson, you'll learn about lift and

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,795
drag and how these aerodynamic forces influence fixed-wing flights.

10
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,359
In later lessons, you'll learn more about the Physics

11
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,829
which govern fixed-wing vehicles and how you can

12
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,379
actually control a fixed-wing vehicle by issuing

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,200
commands to the propulsion system and the control surfaces.
