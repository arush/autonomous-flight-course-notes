00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Welcome back and congratulations on completing the first term of the Nanodegree program.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,355
Up until now, we've been focusing our attention on quadrotors.

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:11,870
A quadrotor is what's known as a rotary wing aircraft.

4
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:14,399
We call rotary wing because each of the propellers is

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,399
actually a wing which spins to the air to generate lift.

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,989
But as you know rotary wing vehicles aren't the only aircraft design,

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,848
there are also fixed-wing aircrafts,

8
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,184
like the one you see here.

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:29,369
This is footage from the fixed wing simulation environment that you'll be using soon.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,850
As you can see, instead of using a motor to spin the blade,

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,420
a fixed wing vehicle uses its own velocity through the air to generate lift.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,439
But there are other vehicle designs besides fixed-wing and rotary wing vehicles.

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,500
For example, there are vehicles like Cora.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,579
Cora is made by Kitty Hawk and it's a hybrid fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.

15
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,759
When we use the term flying car in this Nanodegree program,

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,599
we're generally referring to a hybrid vehicle like this.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,789
A flying car like Cora has three important capabilities.

18
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,990
First, it's capable of VTOL or vertical takeoff and landing.

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,090
This means it can operate without needing a long runway to take off and land.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,799
Second, it's capable of both rotary wing flight and fixed wing flight,

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,450
which comes with some benefits that we'll discuss shortly.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,320
Third, a flying car has to be able to operate autonomously.

23
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,089
It's not practical or safe to ask everyone to become a pilot,

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,510
so a realistic flying car needs to be able to fly itself.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,165
Implementing these three capabilities means solving

26
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:32,390
three main technical challenges on the software side.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,165
One, autonomous flight and rotor craft mode this is something you can already do.

28
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:40,315
Two, autonomous flight in fixed wing mode.

29
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,504
This is what you'll be learning about in the next few lessons.

30
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:47,104
Three, how to transition from hover to fixed-wing flight.

31
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:49,640
This transition period is a very difficult,

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,959
and it's an open question on the best way to solve this problem.

33
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,339
We'll be focusing most of this lesson

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,174
and the lessons that follow on the second challenge.

35
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,569
How can we make a fixed wing vehicle fly autonomously.

36
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,189
But for now I'd like to talk a bit about some of

37
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,129
the many ways that people have tried to design hybrid vehicles.
