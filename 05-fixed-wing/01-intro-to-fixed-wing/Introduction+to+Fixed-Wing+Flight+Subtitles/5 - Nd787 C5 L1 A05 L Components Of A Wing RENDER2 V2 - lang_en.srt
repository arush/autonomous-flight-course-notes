00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
We've looked at the components of a fixed-wing vehicle overall,

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,550
now, let's look more closely at the wing.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,634
The wing is where most of our lift comes from.

4
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:10,169
So, we need to understand properties of the shape and

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,984
size of the wing to understand how much lift we are going to have.

6
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,855
When we discuss the shape of a wing,

7
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:18,765
we use words like platform, airfoil and camber.

8
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,679
The platform of the wing refers to the entire horizontal shape of the wing.

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,695
So, the platform is what we see when we look at the wing from above.

10
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,539
If we look at the cross-sectional shape of the wing,

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,554
then we're looking at the airfoil.

12
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:35,325
The airfoil refers to a slice through the wing at a particular point.

13
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:37,465
For a low speed ultralight aircraft,

14
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:42,670
the airfoil might look like this while the airfoil for an airliner might look like this.

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,000
We can quantify the shape of the airfoil by its camber.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,409
The camber is essentially the curvature of

17
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,409
the upper surface of the wing relative to the bottom surface.

18
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,559
So, this wing on the top has more camber than the weighing on the bottom.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,250
In addition to shape, we also want to discuss the size of a wing.

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,320
The wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other and

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,060
the semi span is the distance from

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,000
the center of the aircraft to the tip of one of the wings.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,140
We typically use the letter B to represent wingspan and the letter S for semi span,

24
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,864
which means that S is equal to B over two.

25
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:19,464
The length from the leading edge of the wing to the trailing edge is called the chord.

26
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:23,990
The chord will usually vary in length as you travel along this semi span.

27
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,584
When the chord varies continuously,

28
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,484
it could be hard to do lift calculations.

29
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:31,879
So, we take an average which is known as the mean aerodynamic chord.

30
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,679
We usually represent the mean aerodynamic chord as C bar.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,850
The aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the semi span to the mean aerodynamic chord.

32
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:45,679
So, short wide wing will have a small aspect ratio while a long skinny wing,

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,515
will have a large aspect ratio.

34
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:52,275
There are various pros and cons associated with large versus small aspect ratios.

35
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:55,905
All of these terms become very important when you get into wing design.

36
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:59,099
Wing design isn't something we're going to get into in this curriculum,

37
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,280
but it's still important to be familiar with these terms.
