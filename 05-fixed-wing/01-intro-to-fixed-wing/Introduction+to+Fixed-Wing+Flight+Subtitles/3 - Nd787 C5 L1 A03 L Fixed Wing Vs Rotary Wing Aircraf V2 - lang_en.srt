00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,625
Before we jump into the details of fixed-wing dynamics and controls,

2
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,910
it's worth understanding the high level trade-offs

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,120
associated with fixed-wing versus rotary-wing aircraft design.

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,799
The reason why flying cars do use a hybrid design is because they really need to.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,810
If you try to design a useful flying car with

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,210
a purely rotary-wing design or purely fixed-wing design,

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,330
you'll pretty quickly see some problems that will be hard to deal with.

8
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,099
We can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,175
each design by playing around in simulation.

10
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:33,990
Here, you can see one obvious strength of rotary-wing aircraft vertical takeoff.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,105
Along with vertical takeoff and landing,

12
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:40,064
a rotary-wing aircraft is much easier to control than a fixed-wing vehicle.

13
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:42,320
Here you can see it hovering in place,

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,924
which is something that a fixed-wing vehicle could never do.

15
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,244
This is really nice for navigation, planning, and safety.

16
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:52,669
The rotor craft have drawbacks for one thing they are very inefficient.

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,700
Even hovering in place requires using a good deal

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,810
of power to keep the rotors turning and generating lift.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,365
This inefficiency drastically reduces the payload size,

20
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:04,855
range, and flight time of rotor craft.

21
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:08,850
Additionally, these vehicles tend to be pretty slow and quite noisy.

22
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,204
Finally, these vehicles have little to no capability when they lose power.

23
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,489
You can see that when I disarm the rotors,

24
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:18,399
bad things happen to the vehicle.

25
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:21,619
That brings us to fixed-wing vehicles.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,079
One of the biggest drawbacks of fixed-wing flight is that

27
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,539
these vehicles need a long runway for takeoff.

28
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,640
Once a fixed wing vehicle gets in the air,

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,245
it has a lot of advantages though.

30
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,630
First, you can see that this vehicle is

31
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,844
moving a lot faster than the quad-rotor ever could.

32
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:37,534
In addition to being faster,

33
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:41,030
these vehicles are also much more efficient than rotor craft.

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,215
That's because instead of using a motor to spin its wings,

35
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:47,090
a fixed-wing vehicle uses its own motion through

36
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,204
the air to keep air flowing over the wing and generating lift.

37
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:55,295
This allows fixed-wing vehicles to carry much heavier payloads much longer distances.

38
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,484
This approach to generating lift also has other benefits.

39
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,790
For example, if the motor cuts out while you're flying,

40
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,650
the vehicle doesn't fall out of the sky and in

41
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,640
fact you can still do quite a bit to control it.
