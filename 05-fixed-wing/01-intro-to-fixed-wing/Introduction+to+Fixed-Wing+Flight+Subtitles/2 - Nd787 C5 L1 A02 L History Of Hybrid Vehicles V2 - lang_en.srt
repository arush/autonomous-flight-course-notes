1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
In between pure rotary wing aircraft and

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,859
pure fixed-wing aircraft is a whole pile of

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,620
different hybrid aircraft that have the ability both to hover,

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,640
that is, generate lift without forward motion and also fly forward

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,285
using fixed-wing surfaces to generate lift aerodynamically from the forward motion.

6
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:21,839
The variation between these vehicles is almost always in how lift is generated in hover.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,859
Some so-called tilt-wing aircraft rotate their entire wing.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,875
But, this can be complicated and costly.

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,409
Other aircraft like the V-22 Osprey are called tiltrotors.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,399
These vehicles keep their wings fixed in

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,679
a horizontal configuration and tilt only the rotors.

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,704
The Fairchild FZ3 takes an interesting approach.

13
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,195
This vehicle can tilt two-thirds of its wing downward like a flap.

14
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:49,189
This generates lift by redirecting the horizontal airflow from the propellers downwards.

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:51,429
Other vehicles, like the Harrier Jump Jet,

16
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,109
have what's called vectored thrust,

17
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:57,005
which allows the engines to direct the thrust downwards instead of backwards.

18
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,020
Other vehicles called tail-sitters take off and land in

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,120
a vertical configuration and then use

20
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,819
their control surfaces to pitch forward to go into aerodynamic flight.

21
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,734
The F-35B takes yet another approach.

22
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,939
It has a large fan in the center of

23
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,670
the vehicle which provides vertical thrust during take-off and landing.

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,900
Despite all of these different approaches to hybrid vehicle design,

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,625
only two hybrid vehicles are still in production,

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,459
the F-35B and the V-22 Osprey.

27
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,819
The Harrier is also still in operation,

28
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,044
but hasn't been manufactured for several years.

29
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:30,799
The main problem with all of these aircraft is that

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,289
they can be very difficult to control in transition,

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,340
that is, when they go from hover to aerodynamic flight and back again.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,305
We're not going to try to solve this transition problem in this module.

33
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:45,080
Instead, we're going to focus on autonomous fixed-wing flight.
