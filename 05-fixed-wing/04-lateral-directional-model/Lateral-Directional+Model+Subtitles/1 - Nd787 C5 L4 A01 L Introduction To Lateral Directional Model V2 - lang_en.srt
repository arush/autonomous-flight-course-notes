00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,285
Welcome back. Up until now,

2
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:05,099
we've been focused on the longitudinal motion of the vehicle,

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,639
where we look at the aircraft from a profile view.

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,580
From this view, it was easy for us to define the angle of attack as

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,349
the difference between the direction the vehicles

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,144
moving and the direction that the body frame is pointing.

7
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:20,134
In this lesson, we're going to focus on the lateral motion of the vehicle.

8
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:25,380
To do that, we're going to look at the vehicle from above and from behind.

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,519
Once again, we'll find that sometimes the vehicles direction of

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,570
travel is not the same as the direction the body frame is pointing.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,045
We're going to call this angle the sideslip angle and label it beta.

12
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:38,620
As you'll see in this lesson,

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,279
this sideslip angle is going to play

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,024
an important role in the lateral directional motion of this vehicle.

15
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:47,734
The overall plan for this lesson is similar to the previous lesson.

16
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:52,179
First, we're going to write down the non-linear lateral-directional equations of motion.

17
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,439
Then, we're going to really look at these equations

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,835
with a focus on what's called the side force.

19
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:01,320
We generally want both the side force and the sideslip angle to be equal to zero,

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,625
but that can sometimes be tricky when we want to turn a fixed wing vehicle for example.

21
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,129
To solve that problem,

22
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,890
we'll talk about something called the coordinated turn,

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,709
as a technique for properly managing the forces so that turns

24
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:16,024
can be executed safely and comfortably for the passengers.

25
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,410
Once we understand the forces on the vehicle,

26
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,379
will develop a linearize model.

27
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:23,734
We'll analyze the eigenvalues of this model stability matrix

28
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:27,560
and identify the three well-known lateral-directional modes.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,250
By the end of this lesson,

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,239
you'll have an intuitive understanding for the cause of these three modes and you'll

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,364
be able to use linear algebra to predict the behavior of fixed wing vehicles.

32
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:41,560
For now, let's jump into the equations of motion in the lateral direction.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,019
We'll start by writing the equations for the force free case,

34
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,439
and then afterwards we can add the forces back in.
