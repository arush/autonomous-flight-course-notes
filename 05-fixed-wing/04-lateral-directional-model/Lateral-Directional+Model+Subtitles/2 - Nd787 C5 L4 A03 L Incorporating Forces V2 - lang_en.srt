00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
These 11 equations, are the equations of motion

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,459
for a vehicle with no forces acting on it.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,210
Below this video, you'll find the full versions of these equations with forces added in.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm not going to go over each of these equations individually,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,585
but there is one equation that's worth discussing and that's the equation for v dot.

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:24,094
Remember, u, v, and w gives the velocity of the vehicle in the body frame,

7
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,404
along the x, y, and z axes.

8
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:32,500
So, v dot is the lateral acceleration of the vehicle in the left or right direction.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,429
This lateral acceleration is caused by all the lateral forces on the vehicle.

10
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,394
Collectively refer to these forces as side force.

11
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:43,960
In general, we want side force to be as small as possible,

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,649
since lateral acceleration is generally an uncomfortable sensation for people.

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,399
But before we can minimize side force,

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,634
we need to understand where it comes from.

15
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:55,564
With forces added back in,

16
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:59,044
the full equation for v dot looks like this.

17
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:02,810
This first term comes from the component of the vehicle's weight,

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,155
that points are laterally,

19
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:07,150
when the vehicles rolled at some angle phi.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,165
This next term is the dynamic pressure times the surface area of the wing,

21
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,785
multiplied by everything in these brackets here.

22
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:17,489
As you can see, the terms in these brackets depend on,

23
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,914
the size of angle beta,

24
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,350
the roll rate and r rate of the vehicle,

25
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,844
and the ailerons deflection delta a,

26
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:27,289
and the rudder deflection delta r. I encourage you to take

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,800
a few minutes to look at the lateral equations of motion, before moving on.
