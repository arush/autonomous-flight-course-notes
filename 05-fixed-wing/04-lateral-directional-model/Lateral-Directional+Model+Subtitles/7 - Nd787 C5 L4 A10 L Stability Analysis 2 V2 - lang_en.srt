1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
The eigenvalue of the roll mode is generally large.

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:05,370
Which means that it's well damped.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,074
This is largely due to how big the wings are.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,489
The other real eigenvalue mode is called a spiral mode.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,000
This mode is associated with an eigenvalue that can be positive or negative,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,649
but it's generally pretty small,

7
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:21,034
which means it's slow to either damp or diverge.

8
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:23,070
To understand this mode,

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,855
we're going to look at two pictures of the same aircraft at the same time.

10
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,855
We're going to imagine this vehicle is disturbed from straight and level flight,

11
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,390
by a small roll angle phi.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,710
This results in a small lateral side slip velocity

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,770
v. You can actually think of the vehicle is sliding downhill.

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,080
Note that there is a downwards component to this lateral velocity in the body frame,

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,820
since the vehicle is rolled.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,850
As the vehicle moves sideways,

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,760
the vertical tail gets pushed to the left by the incoming air,

18
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,019
which induces a positive yaw rate.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,490
As you saw, when you learned about roll yaw coupling,

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,050
this positive your rate will cause the left wing to experience more lift than the right,

21
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:06,034
which will cause the roll angle to increase even further.

22
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,899
If this mode is unstable,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,650
and this behavior isn't corrected,

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,215
the aircraft would eventually fly a slowly diverging path in roll, yaw,

25
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:18,870
and altitude, and eventually the vehicle would spiral into the ground.

26
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,555
Fortunately, the spiral mode can be dealt with by airplane design.

27
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:25,450
Wing Dihedral can produce a restoring torque,

28
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,240
and a Small Vertical tail can also help reduce the impact of this mode.
