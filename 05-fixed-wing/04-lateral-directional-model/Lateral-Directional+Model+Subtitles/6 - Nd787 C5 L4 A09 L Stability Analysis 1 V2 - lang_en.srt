1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,535
When we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the lateral stability matrix,

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:08,585
we get four eigenvalues which correspond to three dynamic modes.

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:10,520
The first eigenvalue is real,

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,384
negative, and generally large.

5
00:00:12,384 --> 00:00:15,205
This corresponds to what's called the roll mode.

6
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,344
The next eigenvalue is real,

7
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:21,239
generally small, and can be either negative or positive.

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,945
This corresponds to the spiral mode.

9
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:27,969
The last two eigenvalues are complex conjugate pair.

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:32,250
They correspond to a damped oscillatory motion called dutch roll.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,395
Let's look at the roll mode first.

12
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,415
This is the simplest lateral mode.

13
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:39,960
It just describes the damping of roll rate towards zero.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,554
If you imagine looking at a plane from behind,

15
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,079
as it rolls right,

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,729
the right wing hasn't increased effective angle of

17
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,625
attack since it's driving down into the airflow.

18
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,340
The left-wing has exactly the opposite.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,130
Since lift increases with angle of attack,

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,594
this means the right wing will actually experienced more lift than the left-wing,

21
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:03,734
and this will cause a moment which tends to damp the roll rate towards zero.

22
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:08,120
Note that the effect of the roll mode is to damp the roll rate to zero,

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,550
doesn't damp the actual roll angle to zero.
