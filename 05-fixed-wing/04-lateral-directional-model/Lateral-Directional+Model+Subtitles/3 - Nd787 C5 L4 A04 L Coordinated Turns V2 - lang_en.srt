1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,004
Something we haven't really discussed is how to turn a fixed-wing aircraft.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,804
Consider an aircraft flying at constant speed in a circular trajectory.

3
00:00:07,804 --> 00:00:11,570
Even though the magnitude of this aircraft's velocity vector isn't changing,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,505
the direction is constantly changing,

5
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:16,920
and changing direction of the velocity is an acceleration.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,950
This acceleration is always directed towards the center of

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,054
the circle so we call it centripetal acceleration.

8
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:25,890
For any object to move in a circle at constant speed,

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,370
there needs to be a centripetal force that provides this acceleration,

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,539
and the size of that force must be equal to MV squared over R,

11
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,195
where M is the mass of the object,

12
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:37,630
V is the speed, and R is the radius of the circle.

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,295
So, if you want an airplane to fly a circular trajectory like this,

14
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:43,005
we'd need a force directed inwards,

15
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:46,150
and the size of that force has to be equal to MV squared

16
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,729
over R. One option would be to generate a side force,

17
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,949
but we just talked about how lateral accelerations

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,545
are perceived as uncomfortable by passengers.

19
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:58,005
So what we really need is something called a coordinated turn.

20
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,280
A coordinated turn works by rolling the vehicle,

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,125
and using a component of the vehicles lift vector as the centripetal force for the turn.

22
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,480
Consider an aircraft viewed from behind.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,800
From this angle, we can see the lift and weight vectors which point up and down.

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,239
The idea behind a coordinated turn is to roll the vehicle so that a component of

25
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,574
the lift force actually points towards the center of the circle we want to follow.

26
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:25,280
Here, we see the aircraft rolled to some angle phi.

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,710
Now, the lift vector has a vertical component given by L cosine phi,

28
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,704
and a horizontal component given by L sine phi.

29
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:35,700
This horizontal component is the centripetal force,

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,570
so it must be equal to M times V squared over R.

31
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,979
The vertical component bounces the weight so it must be equal to

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,115
M times G. If we divide these two equations,

33
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,199
we're left with this,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,180
the tangent of phi is equal to V squared over R times G. Or,

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,790
we can take the inverse tangent of both sides.

36
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,710
We can use this equation to determine what roll angle

37
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,659
we need in order to follow a circle of a certain radius,

38
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,439
while moving at a certain speed.
