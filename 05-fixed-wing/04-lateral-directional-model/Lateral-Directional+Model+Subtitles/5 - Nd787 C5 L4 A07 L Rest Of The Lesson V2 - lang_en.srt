1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,194
The rest of this lesson is going to look pretty familiar.

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,740
We're going to start by developing

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,875
a linearized model of the lateral dynamics around a trim state.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,919
This is going to allow us to express the dynamics in terms

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,949
of the stability matrix and a control effect matrix.

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,250
To analyze the dynamic stability of the system,

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,320
we're going to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stability matrix.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,675
When we do this, we're going to find three lateral modes.

9
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,699
These modes are well known in aviation,

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,175
and are called the roll mode,

11
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:29,600
the spiral mode and Dutch roll.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,520
Once we've identified these modes,

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,229
we're going to discuss them and try to get

14
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,875
some physical insight into the underlying dynamics of each mode.

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,765
To avoid boring you with math,

16
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,500
we're going to present the linearized model in text.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,670
You're welcome to try to derive it yourself,

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,560
but you should also feel free to take it as it's given.
