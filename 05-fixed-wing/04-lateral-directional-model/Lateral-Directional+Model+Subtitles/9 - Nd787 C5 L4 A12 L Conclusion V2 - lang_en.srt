1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
We started this lesson with a full non-linear equations of

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,359
motion for the lateral-directional dynamics of fixed-wing flight,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,484
and we use these equations to understand some important concepts related to flight.

4
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:13,139
For example, you learned about side slip

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,975
and its impact on the side force of vehicle experiences.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,839
You also learned how to steer a fixed-wing vehicle

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,039
without introducing excessive uncomfortable side force,

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,079
by performing a coordinated turn.

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,250
You learned about the static stability,

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,710
including role stability and yaw stability of a fixed-wing aircraft.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,964
But, as we saw in the last lesson,

12
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:36,255
there's only so much we can learn by studying the non-linear equations of motion.

13
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:38,085
In the last half of this lesson,

14
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,865
we linearize the equations of motion around trim.

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:42,620
We studied the eigenvalues of

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,289
the resulting stability matrix and identified three lateral dynamic modes,

17
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:50,734
the Roll mode, the Spiral mode, and the Dutch roll mode.

18
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:56,115
By now, you should have a good sense for just how unintuitive fixed-wing dynamics can be.

19
00:00:56,115 --> 00:00:58,640
For example, you might not have guessed that

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,649
a yawing motion would induce a rolling moment but that actually does happen.

21
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,329
Now that we have some understanding about some of

22
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,200
the unintuitive dynamics that govern fixed-wing flight,

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,219
we're almost ready to start using that

24
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,039
understanding to actually control a fixed-wing vehicle.
