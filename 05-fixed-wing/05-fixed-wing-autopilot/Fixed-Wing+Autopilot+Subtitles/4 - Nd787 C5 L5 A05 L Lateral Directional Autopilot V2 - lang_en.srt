1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
We're going to separate the control problem into

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,960
two separate autopilots: the lateral directional autopilot,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,679
and the longitudinal autopilot.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,544
Let's start with the lateral directional autopilot.

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,905
The lateral directional autopilot has two jobs: maintain the desired heading,

6
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,739
and keep sideslip to a minimum.

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,559
Each of these responsibilities is handled through its own controller.

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,439
The course controller maintains heading by controlling the ailerons.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,109
So, it takes a commanded heading angle as input,

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,884
and produces an aileron command as output,

11
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:33,175
and this controller is actually a nested controller.

12
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:37,098
The outer loop uses the heading to generate a target roll angle,

13
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:41,244
and the inner loop uses the error enroll angle to command the ailerons.

14
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:43,864
This inner loop will be a PD controller.

15
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:46,490
Why don't we have an integral term in this inner loop?

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,118
Remember that the integrator's job is to handle any modeling errors,

17
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:53,329
but it can take some time for the integrator to get to the right value,

18
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,329
which limits how quickly the inner loop can respond.

19
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,850
We're going to try and get the inner loop's model of

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,810
the vehicle dynamics as accurate as possible to avoid needing an I term,

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,960
which will make the inner loop more responsive to disturbances.

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,959
Of course, if we have a more responsive inner loop,

23
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,479
we also want to make sure it doesn't over react to disturbances,

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,930
so we definitely want a D term to damp this loop.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,030
This outer loop will be a PI controller.

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,855
Here is where we can use an I term to handle any errors in our model,

27
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,160
and because it'll be a much slower loop,

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,140
we don't need to damp it with a D term.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,670
Responsiveness isn't as much an issue here.

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,689
The sideslip controller controls the sideslip angle with the rudder.

31
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,384
Generally, the target sideslip angle will be zero,

32
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:39,510
but there are some situations where that won't be the case.

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,984
This controller will be a PI controller.

34
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:44,510
Together, these three controllers,

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,969
each with two tunable parameters will be

36
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:50,670
enough to control the lateral directional motion of the vehicle.
