00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
Welcome back. You've learned about the dynamics that govern fixed-wing flight,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,964
and now it's time to talk about how we actually control a fixed-wing vehicle.

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,650
There are many ways to handle fixed-wing control,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,410
but PID controller is one effective approach,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,045
and it's the approach that we're going to take in this lesson.

6
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,630
A lot of what you see in this lesson should look

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,660
familiar but we're going to discuss a few new concepts,

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,905
and practical considerations as well.

9
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,730
After this lesson, you will be able to implement

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,800
your own autopilot to control a fixed-wing vehicle.
