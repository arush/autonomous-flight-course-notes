00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
In this module, we're going to look at the question of estimation.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,560
There are several forms of the estimation question,

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,019
but the most basic is where is the vehicle,

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,424
what's its attitude and how fast is it going?

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:14,734
Answering these questions is often referred to as navigation or localization,

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:20,050
but there are other questions you could ask such as what is around the vehicle?

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,615
Estimation shows up in techniques called mapping

8
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:25,434
and slam which you may have seen in other courses.

9
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,625
Another question you might ask is,

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,234
well there are other vehicles in the sky, where are they?

11
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:34,045
How fast are they going? That is often referred to as tracking.

12
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:37,600
The same mathematical tools that tell us where a vehicle is,

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
what its altitude is and how fast it's going

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,119
can also be used to answer all of these questions as well.

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,384
You might say, well we have GPS and we've got sensors so why does this matter?

16
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,509
Why is it the slightest bit interesting?

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:54,434
And first of all GPS is a great tool for knowing where vehicles are,

18
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:59,535
but estimation is actually what makes GPS work and GPS itself is not perfect.

19
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,699
The other day, I was flying into Boston's Logan Airport and

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,995
the in-flight GPS suddenly put the plane

21
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,600
over the Atlantic and then quickly brought it back again.

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,069
That's really unlikely and a good estimator would know that it's probably

23
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,839
an erroneous GPS measurement and discard it or do something sensible with it.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,100
Estimation underlies a huge number of technologies: flying

25
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,464
vehicles of all kinds from tiny drones to large aircraft rely on estimation.

26
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:26,219
The Apollo spacecraft for example,

27
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,609
was a huge success in terms of estimation,

28
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,579
and estimation also underpins a lot of

29
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,049
how your phone works in terms of

30
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,974
knowing how to orient the screen when you turn your phone.

31
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:40,265
What is at the core of the estimation question is really uncertainty.

32
00:01:40,265 --> 00:01:42,709
The real world is fundamentally uncertain,

33
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,244
and it's uncertain in a couple of important ways,

34
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:48,020
one is that the world is stochastic.

35
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:51,170
The effect of actions can have uncertain outcomes,

36
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,030
the vehicle could be traveling a path you might

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,310
intend for the vehicle to follow this nominal path,

38
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,409
but it might get hit by a gust of wind and blown to one side or the other,

39
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,454
or the vehicle could be flying on some nominal path and suddenly stopped working.

40
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:08,400
That change in state is a source of uncertainty,

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,490
you never know when it's going to happen.

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,040
The second thing is there are things we might be uncertain

43
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,209
about in terms of the current state of the world: where is the vehicle?

44
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,770
What's behind that building over there?

45
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,840
We can't know where everything is in the world and the

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,469
way we describe this is to say that the world is partially observable.

47
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,264
Historically, there are lots of ways to quantify uncertainty.

48
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:32,074
Probability is generally the most common and the most powerful.

49
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,009
People have looked at using other things like

50
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,069
confidence scores or you may have heard of fuzzy logic,

51
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,984
but at the end of the day we're going to stick with probability.

52
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,920
That's because there's good sound theorems for example,

53
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,769
the Dutch Book theorem which says that probability is

54
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,375
the only rational way of representing uncertainty in making decisions.

55
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,344
Either, you are implicitly using the axioms of probability or

56
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:55,580
you're actually going to make a bad decision in terms

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,920
of estimating what the state of the world is.

58
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,539
We're going to talk about probabilities as the relative frequency of outcomes.

59
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's dig in and remind ourselves of how probability works.
