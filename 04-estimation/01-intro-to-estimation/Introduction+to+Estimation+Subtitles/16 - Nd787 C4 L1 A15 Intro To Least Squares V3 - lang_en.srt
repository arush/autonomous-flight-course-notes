1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
If we're doing a thought experiment around estimating the state of a flying car,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,360
the standard least squares approach to

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,505
estimation makes some pretty unrealistic assumptions.

4
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,070
It assumes the vehicle isn't moving,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,554
that the measurements come in all at once,

6
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:18,364
and that the underlying measurement model is noisy but linear.

7
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:20,989
Remember, that a linear function of x,

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,250
which in this case maybe a vehicle position,

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,905
is one that can be written as a times x plus b for some known a and b.

10
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,830
Measurements of things like orientation are rarely

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:34,479
linear and we'll see in a bit how to overcome that assumption.

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,149
But despite these over-simplifications,

13
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,939
this estimation technique is common for calibration,

14
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,959
finding the transform between two coordinate systems or model fitting.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,795
For now, we're going to consider a purely mathematical example of our thought experiment.

16
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:55,795
Let's consider a system where we make m measurements y of a constant vector x.

17
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,664
Such that y equals h times x plus v,

18
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:01,504
where x is the constant unknown state vector

19
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:04,250
of length n. This is the thing we're trying to estimate.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,930
It's our quantity of interest and y tilde is the specific vector of measurements of

21
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,310
length m. I'm going to use the tilde here to denote the actual measurements I received.

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,299
The measurements are a linear function of the state

23
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:20,420
perturbed by some noise and that noise is not known.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,519
It's the unknown error vector.

25
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,589
I'm going to assume the noise is drawn from

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,490
a Gaussian distribution with a zero mean and some covariance r,

27
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,344
which perhaps we can assume is some known variance times the identity matrix.

28
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,549
H is then the measurement matrix.

29
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,715
It's assumed to be constant and known

30
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:40,770
and it projects the state into the measurement space.

31
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,853
Now, if we knew what the error's viewer,

32
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,069
we could subtract them out and then that would just

33
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,869
leave y tilde minus v equals H times x,

34
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,439
and we could solve for x.

35
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,274
Or if we knew x,

36
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,690
we can solve for the errors.

37
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,134
Well, we don't know either of these,

38
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,350
that's what makes this an estimation problem.

39
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:01,349
What we're going to do is use a maximum likelihood estimation approach.

40
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,209
Intuitively, what we're going to do is look at our measurements and ask

41
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,079
what vehicle state is the most likely to yield this particular set of measurements.
