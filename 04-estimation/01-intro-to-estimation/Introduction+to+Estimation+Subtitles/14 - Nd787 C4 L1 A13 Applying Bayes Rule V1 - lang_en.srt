1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So, how can we use Bayes' rule? Let's take a look.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,589
For example, imagine that we don't know where our vehicle is,

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,394
but we have some knowledge about roughly where it is.

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:13,320
We'll call this a prior, maybe it's a Gaussian.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,600
We know the vehicle position is distributed with some mean and some variance.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,845
That variance can capture how well we think we know where the vehicle is.

7
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:26,689
Imagine that the position of our flying car is measured with GPS,

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,020
but the GPS is corrupted by guessing errors or noise.

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,159
We'll say that the measurement y equals x plus v,

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,529
where x is the true position of the vehicle,

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,990
v is the air added during measurement,

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,660
and y is the received measured value.

13
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:45,634
We can assume that the position is independent of the measurement noise,

14
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:48,799
which means x is independent of v. Can we

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,114
compute the distribution over the position given the measurement?

16
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,950
That is, can we find p of x given y?

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,705
Well, we can show from the chain rule the y is going to take this form,

18
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,045
and y given x is going to take that form,

19
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:05,239
but we don't want p of y or p of y given x,

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,024
we want to know p of x given y.

21
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,245
We can use Bayes rule to find it.

22
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,030
P of x given y,

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,250
is going to be equal to p of y given x times p of x divided by p of y,

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,200
and if I plug in normal distributions into this equation, I'm left with this.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,439
This is the product of two normal distributions,

26
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,629
divided by a third normal distribution,

27
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,209
and with some algebra,

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:32,054
we can show that the product and division actually results in another Gaussian.

29
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:37,830
In fact, whenever we multiply a normal distribution by a different normal distribution,

30
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,379
the result is also a normal distribution.

31
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:43,185
In this case, the resulting normal distribution

32
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:46,064
has a new mean and variance which look like this,

33
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,819
and there's some interesting properties that result from this multiplication.

34
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,009
Notice that we're taking the measurement and essentially applying it as a correction to

35
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,760
the initial estimate mu of x. If sigma v is small compared to sigma x,

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,770
that means we have more trust in our measurement than in our initial estimate,

37
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:09,564
and that results in a new estimate which is centered very close to the measurement.

38
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:15,034
On the other hand, if we trust our prior a lot sigma x is small compared to sigma v,

39
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,174
then we wind up trusting our prior more than our new measurement,

40
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:20,469
and the updated position estimate only gets moved

41
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,245
slightly in the direction of the measurement.

42
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:26,710
And so sigma x and sigma v are

43
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,805
basically trading off how much we trust one quantity versus another.

44
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:35,290
That's a concept that we're going to see a lot throughout this estimation module.
