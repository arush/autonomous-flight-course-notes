00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,059
So far, we've discussed discrete events such as the number of visible GPS satellites,

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,074
or the state of the vehicle being working or not working.

3
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,209
What about continuous samples spaces,

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,920
such as the real value position of a satellite?

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,684
Random variables become extremely powerful in this case.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:23,294
Using real numbers to index the members of a continuous set, it's fairly intuitive.

7
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:26,880
Let's first begin by defining a specific function called

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,674
the cumulative distribution function F sub x of u.

9
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,350
This function F sub x of u with a capital F,

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,730
describes the probability that the random variable x is less than or equal

11
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,179
to u. F will be monotonically increasing.

12
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,909
The limit as u goes to negative infinity is zero,

13
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:48,839
and the limit as u goes to a positive infinity is one.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the cumulative distribution function.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,619
It's important to understand that the index to the function is u,

16
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:00,879
but its sub-scripted by x to indicate which random variable we're characterizing by

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,969
the probability that the value of that random variable is less than u or not.

18
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,260
Now, we can define lowercase f sub x of u,

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,320
which is equal to the derivative with respect to u of uppercase F sub x of u.

20
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,954
This is what we call a probability density function.

21
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,159
Since we are dealing with a continuous sample space,

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,179
we can no longer say anything about the probability

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,420
that our vehicle is at some specific or exact location,

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,609
because for a continuous sample space,

25
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,834
the probability of any particular value will always be zero.

26
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:38,319
We can only give the probability that our vehicle is in some region.

27
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,094
Consider this uniform probability density function for the position x of a vehicle.

28
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:49,480
As you can see, it has the value one half between x equals zero and two,

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,250
and zero everywhere else.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,838
I could calculate the probability that the vehicles in this region between zero and one,

31
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,894
by calculating the area under this curve,

32
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:00,075
which would be one times one half.

33
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:05,920
In fact, the probability that a random variable will take a value between x1 and x2,

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,705
is just given by the integral of the probability density function from x1 to x2.

35
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,700
This lowercase f of x isn't the probability,

36
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,939
and it can easily be greater than one.

37
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,419
But we do often write this density function as p of x.

38
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,405
This changes our notion of what it means to be a proper distribution.

39
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:26,145
To be a proper density,

40
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:30,439
lowercase f sub x of u has to be greater than or equal to zero,

41
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,909
and the integral under the distribution has to be equal to one.

42
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,150
Normalization implies finding a constant multiplier in

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,920
front of this density function to make it integrate to one.
