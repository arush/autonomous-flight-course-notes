00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,665
For the rest of this lesson,

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:04,439
I want to introduce you to three approaches to estimation.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,470
All three of these approaches will, in some sense,

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,699
solve the same problem,

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,114
but each will do so in a slightly different way.

6
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:15,855
The goal of estimation is to come up with an estimate for some unknown state.

7
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,949
We'll denote this unknown state by the vector x,

8
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:21,419
and for the estimate of the state, we'll use x^.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,165
Note that these are both vectors.

10
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,914
For 2D quadrator moving in the vertical plane,

11
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:27,899
this would be y, and z,

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,554
and the roll angle phi, and the corresponding derivatives.

13
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:33,200
In the exercises is you see in this lesson,

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,830
these state vectors will be smaller,

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,199
and the examples we use won't necessarily relate directly to quadrotors.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,935
Because for now, we want to focus on the math that

17
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:44,445
underlies the three approaches to estimation that we'll discuss.

18
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,450
So, how will we come up with this estimate x^?

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,595
What information will we have access to?

20
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,634
In each of these three approaches,

21
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,734
we'll have three things.

22
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,435
First, we'll have some measurement model,

23
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:01,790
H. A measurement model projects a state into measurement space.

24
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:06,390
Let's say we had our 2D quadrotor with some true state vector x.

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,939
It's at some vertical position z,

26
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,745
and it has a laser range finder pointing downwards.

27
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,620
If this were a perfect sensor,

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,689
it would measure a distance to the ground that's

29
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,659
equal to z divided by the cosine of phi.

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,965
In this case, the state's space was y and z of phi in the derivatives.

31
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:25,200
The measurement space, one dimensional,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,375
and H is the function that maps a state to a measurement.

33
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,254
Next, we're going to get some measurements.

34
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:33,239
We represent a measurement with y.

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,899
And in each of these examples,

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,050
we'll consider making m measurements of the true state x,

37
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,250
where each measurement would be given by y equals H times x.

38
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,935
If these were perfect measurements. But they aren't.

39
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:49,465
Instead, each measurement will actually be y equals H times y plus v.

40
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:52,150
The v here is the measurement noise and that brings

41
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,895
us to the last thing we need to provide to our estimator.

42
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,989
Since the measurements are imperfect,

43
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,459
we need some model of this measurement noise v. Note that this

44
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,419
doesn't mean we'll know exactly how much noise gets added to each individual measurement,

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,935
that will still be unknown.

46
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:10,104
Rather, it means that we know the distribution from which this noise is sampled.

47
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:16,405
Generally, we're going to model v as a zero mean Gaussian or some co-variance r. So,

48
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:20,099
where a perfect rangefinder would make some perfect measurement H times x,

49
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,150
a realistic rangefinder would also add some zero mean Gaussian noise to each measurement.

50
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,395
The three approaches we'll discuss in the rest of this lesson are called,

51
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,439
least squares estimation, recursive estimation,

52
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,764
and non-linear least squares.

53
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,299
Each of these three approaches makes

54
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,550
slightly different assumptions about

55
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,715
the measurements and the underlying measurement model.

56
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:45,530
The least squares approach, for example,

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,729
requires that the measurements all come in all at once,

58
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,254
and it assumes that the measurement model H is n by m matrix,

59
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:54,549
which maps a state vector of length n,

60
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,505
to a measurement vector of m individual measurements.

61
00:02:57,504 --> 00:03:00,620
Note that this means the measurement model must be linear,

62
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,210
which wouldn't have worked for example earlier with

63
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,969
the rangefinder since that measure model had a cosine in it.

64
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,250
These are some pretty unrealistic assumptions,

65
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,030
but this will be a useful starting point for discussing estimation.

66
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,995
With the recursive estimator,

67
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,185
measurements will come in one at a time.

68
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,479
The measurement model will still be linear,

69
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,970
but since measurements are coming in one at a time,

70
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,039
H will just be a vector, not a matrix,

71
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,444
and this vector will map a state to a single measurement.

72
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:31,500
The non-linear least squares estimator is also recursive,

73
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,840
which allows us to handle measurements coming in one at a time.

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,340
But in this case,

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,854
we'll allow the measurement model to be some arbitrary function of the underlying state.

76
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,449
One last point I'd like to make.

77
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,084
If you were to use any of these approaches to estimate the state of a real vehicle,

78
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:50,080
you'd have to make one more assumption.

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,800
The vehicle would have to be stationary for any of these approaches to work.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
In the later lessons,

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,969
we'll see how we can use

82
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,180
the common filters and its variants called the extended common filter and the

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,640
unscented common filter to incorporate motion into our state estimation process.
