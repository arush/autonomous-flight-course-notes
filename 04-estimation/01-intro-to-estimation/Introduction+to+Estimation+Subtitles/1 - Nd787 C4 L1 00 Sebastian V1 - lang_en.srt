1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Estimation is something that you and I do every waking moment.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,824
For example, right now, I'm getting sound waves in your ear with my voice,

3
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,219
and somewhere in your brain,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,480
you form a belief as to what words I just uttered.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,929
Okay, this is called estimation.

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,070
Robots have the same estimation problem,

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,240
they need to know where they are X, Y,

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,219
and Z and possibly fetch for the pitches for the rotors.

9
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,144
So now, we're going to focus on estimation.

10
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:29,509
Estimation at its core is a temporal process,

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,679
so you integrate things over time,

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,679
and it's a process of managing uncertainty.

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,979
You can never be 100% certain what I've said or whatever it is.

14
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:44,640
We're going to use Bayes rule as a method to integrate data over time.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,359
Bayes rule is a method to take multiple sources of information,

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,575
and coming up with the distribution that is

17
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,280
the best reflection of what the state might be.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,620
And your goal is going to be to make a very tight distribution,

19
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,839
so as to fights certain ways.
