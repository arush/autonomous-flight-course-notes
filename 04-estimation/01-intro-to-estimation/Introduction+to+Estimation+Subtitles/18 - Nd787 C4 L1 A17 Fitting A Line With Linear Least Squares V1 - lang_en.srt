1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
We now have this equation for the maximum likelihood estimator x hat.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,849
Which is x hat equals,

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,339
h transpose h to the power minus one,

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,980
times h transpose again times y tilde.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,885
It's nice to see that the best estimate is purely a function of our measurement model h,

6
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:18,434
and the actual measurements y tilde.

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,404
Let's look at how this works in practice,

8
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:25,289
in this example we're going to fit some noisy data to a straight line,

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,489
and we can assume that we have the parameters of some line that we don't know,

10
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:30,914
which should be drawn like that.

11
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:35,490
The axes I'm going to call t since we're already using x for the state and y.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,405
Which means that the true equation of this line is

13
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,204
y equals a times t plus b for sum a and sum b.

14
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:46,960
Let's assume that our data is sampled from the line with some added noise.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,585
Well, what we're actually looking for the properties of this line,

16
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:53,015
what we actually want are a and our b,

17
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:56,365
a and b together are unknown state vector x.

18
00:00:56,365 --> 00:01:00,425
We assume that our measurements y sub one, y sub two etc,

19
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:03,459
are drawn according to a linear function of y sub i,

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,870
which is equal to a times t sub i,

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,855
plus b plus v sub i.

22
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:11,380
It's this unknown v sub i that's perturbing the measurements from the line.

23
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:14,849
The measurements are in the form of y tilde equals h times x

24
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:18,629
plus v. We have all these measured values,

25
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,629
y tilde sub one up to y tilde sub m,

26
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,390
and we have our state vector x equals a and b.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,590
In order to get the first vector to match up with the second vector,

28
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,185
we need an h that looks like this.

29
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:34,859
The first row is t sub one and one,

30
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,215
then the second row is t sub two and one all the way up to the last row t sub m and one.

31
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:41,879
Now the problem is solved,

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,490
we have our measurements, we have our h,

33
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,609
now we just need to apply our equation for

34
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,094
the maximum likelihood estimate and we'll find our best estimate for x.

35
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:55,564
An important thing to note is that once you have the measurements y tilde,

36
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:58,265
the least squares estimation problem boils down to

37
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,834
figuring out exactly what this measurement model h looks like.

38
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:06,184
Figuring out how to form h for any estimation problem is often the tricky bit.

39
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:07,370
Once you have that,

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,039
it's just a matter of carrying out the math to get the best estimate.
