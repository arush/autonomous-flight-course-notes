1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
We have our measurements and we want to know what vehicle state in

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,265
our thought experiment is most consistent with those measurements. How do we do that?

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:12,720
Mathematically, we're going to select our estimate x-hat to be

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,565
the value of x that maximizes the probability of our actual measurements y-tilde.

5
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,920
There are two steps to this process.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,025
First, we're going to figure out what is the PDF,

7
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,714
the probability density function of p of y given x.

8
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:31,995
Remember, this function tells us the likelihood of the measurement y when the state is x.

9
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,469
We're next going to select our estimate x-hat to be the value that yields

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,960
a maximum likelihood of the actual measurements y-tilde given that estimate x-hat.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,035
These two steps, let's look at them in turn.

12
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:48,244
First, we have to figure out what is the PDF,

13
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:52,549
the probability density function of p of y given x in this model.

14
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:55,484
We're going to assume that this distribution is Gaussian.

15
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,339
That means we need an expression for the parameters,

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,785
that is, the mean and the covariance.

17
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,479
Since y equals Hx plus v,

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,015
it's easy to show that the expected value,

19
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:09,219
the mean, y-bar is equal to H times x.

20
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,569
Given the properties or a noise model it's also easy to show that

21
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,708
the covariance y minus y-bar times y minus y-bar transpose

22
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,590
is going to be equal to the covariance of just the noise and that's equal to

23
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,965
R. We now actually know the parameters of this distribution p of y

24
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,500
given x for any x it's going to be

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,030
a normal distribution with a mean of H times x and covariance

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,189
R. We just need to find a value of x-hat that

27
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,215
maximizes the likelihood of the actual measurements y-tilde given x-hat.

28
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:44,905
How do we do this? Let's look at the full formula for this Gaussian.

29
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,064
Here, I've just written out the formula of the Gaussian.

30
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:53,450
Plugging in effect the mean is H times x and the covariance is R. We can

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,454
see this consists of a normalizer term here which does not depend on x at all.

32
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:03,575
For the likelihood of the received measurements of y-tilde given x,

33
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:07,900
the specific choice of x has no impact on this normalizer and we can ignore it.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,849
If we want to maximize this overall function,

35
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:15,155
then what we actually care about is maximizing the term that's in the exponent here.

36
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:18,754
Which means we just need to maximize the function in the exponent.

37
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,939
A standard way to solve for the maximum of a function like

38
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,569
this is taking the derivative and finding where it is zero.

39
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,905
If we take the derivative of the exponent,

40
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:30,439
set it equal to zero, and then solve for x,

41
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,960
we get this term right here;

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,170
x-hat is equal to H transpose times h to

43
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,649
the power minus one times H transpose again times y-tilde.

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,990
And so, this is a solution to

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,885
the least squares estimation problem given some measurements

46
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,509
y-tilde that are linearly related to

47
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,814
some unknown quantity x by this matrix H that we assume that we know.

48
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:54,759
Using that, we can solve for the most likely estimate, x-hat.
