00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,338
To begin talking about probability,

2
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:03,960
let's define some terms.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,515
Let's say that there's a space of possible things that might happen.

4
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:11,205
For now, we're going to describe a discrete set of possible outcomes.

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:13,679
Before we dig into position estimation,

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,959
let's start very simply and just think

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,870
about whether the vehicle is working or not working.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,440
Each of these we call an event or outcome,

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,940
and together they form our sample space.

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,740
We're going to assign to each one of these

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,239
some probability or relative likelihood of that outcome.

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,670
Let's say, we have a highly reliable vehicle with 0.9

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,315
probability of it working and 0.1 probability of it not working.

14
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:40,140
These numbers with the outcomes define a probability distribution.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,100
To be a properly normalized probability distribution

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,185
the sum of these probabilities has to equal one.

17
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,660
We can in fact write this distribution as

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,629
a function that maps from the outcomes to numbers.

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,810
All probability function maps to numbers between zero and

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,920
one where zero probability means an event is guaranteed to not happen.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,030
At a probability of one means an event is certain to happen.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,519
When we have discrete outcomes we can call this function a probability mass function.

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,579
And if we have relative frequencies of things,

24
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,590
they may not be in the range zero to one,

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,185
but we can make the relative frequency sum to one by normalizing,

26
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,320
taking the sum and dividing.

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,839
Once we have a probability mass function

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
we can use it to answer a couple of questions such as,

29
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,074
what is the probability of some event or

30
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:30,269
outcome given that some other event or outcome occurred.

31
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,879
This is called conditional probability.

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,584
We can also sample from the space of possible outcomes,

33
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:40,905
and for some distributions we can ask what is the most likely event?

34
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:45,000
However, this particular representation where we write

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,079
down the names of the different outcomes is not as helpful as it might be.

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,340
If before working out the probabilities we first have a function that maps

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,659
each outcome to a number then we can ask and answer more questions.

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,614
So, let's say we have a set of outcomes, say,

39
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:03,839
working, not working, and let's add mostly working.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,980
We can map them to the integer numbers zero, one, and two.

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,254
So, now we have this mapping of outcomes to integers and then the probabilities say,

42
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:15,180
0.9, 0.05 and 0.05.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,969
This map of integers to relative frequencies or

44
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,014
probabilities is what's called a random variable.

45
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:25,049
We're going to use as notation the letter X to represent the random variable

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,120
which in this case, is this entire table of integer numbers.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,990
X of I represents one entry in the table,

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,680
P of X represents the column of probabilities in

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,420
this table and then P of X of I would represent one entry in that column.

50
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,689
Now, that we have a random variable that maps events to

51
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,919
numbers we can perform computations over the events.
