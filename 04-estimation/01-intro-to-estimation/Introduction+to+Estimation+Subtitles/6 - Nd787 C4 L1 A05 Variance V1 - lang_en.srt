00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
You can, in fact, compute lots of different functions of random variables,

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,315
but the expected value is one of

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:10,410
two very useful functions of random variables that we'll see a lot.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,120
The expected value is often referred to as expectation, the mean,

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,099
the average, the first moment,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,135
and it is exactly the quantity we had a second ago.

7
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,120
When we drop the i indices,

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,640
that quantity is the sum over all the outcomes of x times p of x.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,115
I'm going to use x bar to represent the expected value of this random variable x.

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,175
Another useful quantity we'll compute a lot is the variance,

11
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:40,579
which is the sum of x minus x bar all squared times p of x.

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,429
The expected value is,

13
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,435
on any given draw from the distribution,

14
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,385
what is the value we expect to get?

15
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:50,489
Not the most likely, but the average value that we'd expect to

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,734
get if we were to continue drawing from this distribution over and over again.

17
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:57,089
The variance, sigma squared,

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,915
tells us how spread out these samples will be around the mean of x.

19
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:05,939
People sometimes use the variance as a measure of how well we know the mean,

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,349
something like a confidence.

21
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,479
It's important to understand it isn't that,

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,195
but it will tell us how much the samples vary.

23
00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:15,554
You might also have heard of a quantity called the standard deviation,

24
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:19,360
where the standard deviation is a square root of the variance.
