00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
I'd like to start by discussing the inertial sensors on board a drone.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,524
These include the gyroscopes and the accelerometers.

3
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:11,009
Unlike a sensor, like GPS,

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,439
which relies on measurements of the outside world to function,

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,719
inertial sensors really measure motion by taking advantage of

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,979
the physical laws of nature like F equals ma, for example.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,310
So, this drone has inertial measurement unit or IMU in short.

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:35,000
And the IMU on the drone has three accelerometers and three gyros.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,019
Each accelerometer measure specific acceleration along

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,005
one axis and each gyro measures rotation rates around one axis.

11
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:49,020
For flying vehicles, the IMU is usually fixed tightly

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,770
to the vehicle body and positioned at the center of the vehicle,

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,050
so it provides measurements directly in the body frame.

14
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,314
And this is one example of an IMU.

15
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:03,644
It's really tiny and also inexpensive.

16
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:09,375
This one is only a millimeter tall and then a few millimeters on each side.

17
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,750
But inside of this IMU,

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,444
there's actually a lot going on.

19
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:17,744
Here, we have a block diagram of an IMU,

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,859
and as you can see, here,

21
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,284
we have the three accelerometers and here are the three gyros.

22
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,939
There's also a temperature sensor which is

23
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,929
used to correct the measurements of the other sensors.

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,240
Data from these sensors all get fused in the IMU processor.

25
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,414
This processor takes in calibration parameters

26
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:42,705
and of course the raw data from the sensors themselves.

27
00:01:42,704 --> 00:01:45,010
And then, it has to output some data,

28
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,000
which is our measurement.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,424
Note, that some IMUs also contain a magnetometer and barometer integrated in,

30
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,634
but we are handling those separately,

31
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:58,694
since they aren't strictly inertial sensors.

32
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:03,439
For now, let's dive into how these rate Gyros actually work.
