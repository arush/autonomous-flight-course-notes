1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
A gyroscope measures the angular rotation about

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,445
a particular axis by measuring something called the Coriolis Force.

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:12,089
The Coriolis Force is something that shows up when

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:15,974
you try to do physics in a rotating frame of reference.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,669
We are not going to get into the math behind this force,

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,845
but we can try to understand it intuitively.

7
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:25,739
Imagine you are looking from above at

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,494
a big spinning disk that's rotating with some angular velocity Omega.

9
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:34,130
You can think of it like a merry-go-round.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,585
Now, what would happen if someone's standing in the middle of this disc

11
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:42,825
tried to throw a ball at the triangular target shown here?

12
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,780
Well, the ball doesn't care that the disk is rotating.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,649
So of course it would move in

14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,320
a straight line and by the time it got to the edge of the disk,

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,210
the target would have rotated far away from where it originally was.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,024
This picture of the motion is from the world frame,

17
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:02,809
which is an inertial frame.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,230
In this frame, there is no Coriolis Force.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,314
But what happens when we transition into a rotating frame?

20
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,829
Imagine that you were standing on

21
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,864
the triangular target and someone threw the ball towards you.

22
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:18,545
From your point of view,

23
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,085
the ball wouldn't move in a straight line.

24
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:25,625
Instead, you'd see the ball take the strange curved paths.

25
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,370
In this rotating frame of reference,

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,005
you would think the ball were being pushed sideways by some force,

27
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,869
and that force is the Coriolis Force.

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,240
So, we can call it FC.

29
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,769
In fact, you could even measure the effect of the force.

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,950
Luckily for us, the size of this force is

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,365
a function of the rotational speed of the rotating frame.

32
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:52,819
So, if we are careful about the math,

33
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,359
we can use a measurement of FC to infer the rotation rate,

34
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,319
Omega of the rotating reference frame.

35
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,779
The Coriolis Force is a force that we can actually measure,

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,549
and it shows up only when the thing doing

37
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,939
the measurement is in a rotating reference frame.

38
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:17,259
This is the basic physical justification for how a gyroscope could possibly work,

39
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:22,284
but it doesn't tell us how we actually measure the Coriolis Force.

40
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,039
It turns out there are

41
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,824
several gyroscope implementations that have been used on flying vehicles.

42
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:33,969
Some of these rely on mechanically spinning some large view of ball

43
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:39,634
and then measuring the changes to its motions as the vehicle itself rotates.

44
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:44,409
But these large mechanical systems unpractical for smaller vehicles.

45
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,905
The gyros you're likely work with are called Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes.

46
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:53,835
These gyroscopes are small MEMS sensors,

47
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,995
and they are by far the most common gyro.

48
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:01,795
MEMS stands for Microelectromechanical Systems.

49
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:07,389
They work by having two tiny masses called Proof Masses,

50
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,574
which vibrate in opposite directions.

51
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:16,204
When there is no rotation these masses just move along a horizontal line.

52
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:20,050
Now, we can imagine a rotation Omega,

53
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,594
and you should think of this rotation axis as going into the screen.

54
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:26,895
And if we pause the motion here,

55
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:31,935
we can see that the mass on the right has some velocity to the right.

56
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:39,395
This rotation vector points into the screen so that those two vectors are orthogonal.

57
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:44,125
This is going to lead to a Coriolis Force which points upwards.

58
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:51,395
Note that this force is orthogonal to both the velocity and the rotation axis.

59
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,120
For the mass on the left,

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,420
the force is going to point down at this moment.

61
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,674
If you follow this logic,

62
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,314
as the mass vibrates,

63
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:06,254
the resulting motion of the proof masses is no longer going to be exactly horizontal,

64
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:10,109
but will instead have a vertical component as well.

65
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,200
By measuring this deflection in the vertical direction for both proof masses,

66
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,800
you can actually infer the rotational rate Omega of the sensor.

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,285
Now that we know how gyroscopes measure rotational rates,

68
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:28,110
we need to know how accurate these measurements are.

69
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,560
To know that, it will help to develop what's called a measurement model for gyroscope.
