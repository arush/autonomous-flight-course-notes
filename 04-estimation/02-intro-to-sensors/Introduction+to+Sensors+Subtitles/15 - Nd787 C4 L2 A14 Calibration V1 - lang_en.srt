1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
The easiest way to handle errors is by doing what's called, offline calibration.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,095
Let's say I want to calibrate the accelerometers on this drone.

3
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:14,429
If I know this table is flat and I put my drone on it,

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,730
I would expect to see an accelerometer reading of 9.8 meters per second squared upwards.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,855
If I look at the actual measurements and they say something different,

6
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:27,149
then I can introduce a correction,

7
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,284
and that would be offline calibration.

8
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,500
The other approach to calibration is online calibration,

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,109
and we have to use online calibration when the bias slowly changes in flight,

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,945
which is something that the IMUs are notorious for.

11
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:49,185
In online calibration, we actually add the bias into a vehicle state vector.

12
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:53,415
So instead of tracking the usual 12-state variables,

13
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:56,609
we might use a random work model and correct

14
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,350
the three additional accelerometer biases as well.

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,895
When we do offline calibration,

16
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:06,135
we generally need some calibration routine.

17
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:08,700
For example, remember when we looked at

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,564
the specs sheet and we saw the temperature calibration offset,

19
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:15,189
gyros and accelerometer biases have

20
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,799
a temperature dependent component that isn't a function of time.

21
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,409
To get the most out of an IMU,

22
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,359
we would like to know this function,

23
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,459
and the way we do that is with a pretty straightforward calibration routine.

24
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,379
So for this IMU,

25
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,179
we could just set it on a table with some known orientation and then

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,805
we can put it through a range of temperatures and observe the bias at each temperature.

27
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,070
Once we have our data,

28
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,029
we can use least-squares to fit a polynomial to the data,

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,579
and then we have a model of how temperature influences bias.
