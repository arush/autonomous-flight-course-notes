00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,865
Let's talk about GPS.

2
00:00:02,865 --> 00:00:05,610
If you ask me, GPS is one of

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,660
the most impressive technologies that humans have ever developed.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,300
Think about it. Right now,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,330
there is a system of satellites orbiting

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,245
20,000 kilometers above the surface of the earth.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,560
On board of each of these satellites is a clock,

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,559
and each of these satellites constantly

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,384
broadcasts its clock time to the surface of the earth.

10
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,164
The system of satellites broadcasting clock times is

11
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:37,484
actually able to localize anyone at any position on

12
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:41,265
Earth to within a few meters of accuracy if

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:45,780
they have a GPS receiver and an unobstructed view of the sky.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,950
That's pretty amazing.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,925
At this point in the lesson,

16
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:54,030
I want to explain how GPS works and how we can take

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,054
advantage of this incredible technology to localize flying vehicles.

18
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:00,765
So, how does it work?

19
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:03,780
Well, GPS actually gives us

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,239
a direct and drift-free measurement of both position and velocity.

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,155
So let's start by discussing how we get position from GPS.

22
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:21,105
GPS uses something called trilateration to measure the position of a GPS receiver.

23
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,900
Trilateration requires a direct line of sight from

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,665
a GPS receiver to at least four satellites,

25
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:32,460
and it relies on the fact that we can measure the time of

26
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,404
flight from the transmitting satellite to the receiver.

27
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:42,010
To understand trilateration, it's easiest to think in two-dimensions first.

28
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,285
Imagine you have no idea where you are but you

29
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:48,899
do know the position of this single satellite.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,480
If you know the time it takes a signal to get from the satellite to you,

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,909
then you can use the speed of flight to convert this time into a distance.

32
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,519
And this distance defines the radius of a circle around this satellite.

33
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,354
So with this one time of flight measurement,

34
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:12,689
you now know that your position must be somewhere on this circle.

35
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,550
Now, if we add a second satellite and measure the time of flight,

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,800
we'll get a second circle that intersects with the first circle at two points.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,719
So now, you know that you must be either here or here.

38
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,109
A third satellite with a third measurement would give you

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,350
one more circle and then you would know with certainty exactly where you are.

40
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,185
In three dimensions, this changes slightly.

41
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:47,215
The first satellite would define a sphere of possible receiver locations.

42
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:51,405
The second satellite would add another sphere which,

43
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,650
taken together with the first one,

44
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,659
would give you a circle.

45
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,454
And then, the third satellite would give you

46
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:04,570
another sphere which intersected that circle in two points.

47
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,750
And actually, these two points are enough to locate you unambiguously,

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,370
because one of these points will be somewhere

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,890
near the surface of the Earth and the other will

50
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,349
be deep in space out past the orbital radius of the GPS satellites.

51
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,039
You might be tempted to think that this means we only

52
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,864
need three satellites to localize a receiver with GPS,

53
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:29,905
but we still need four.

54
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:34,960
The fourth satellite is used to correct for something called the clock error.
