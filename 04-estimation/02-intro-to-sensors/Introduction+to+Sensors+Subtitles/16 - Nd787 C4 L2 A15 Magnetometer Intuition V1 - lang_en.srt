00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,610
The next sensor I want to discuss is the compass or magnetometer.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,910
The magnetometer is able to make measurements of

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,080
the vehicle's yaw when we know the vehicle's pitch and roll.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,990
And this measurement of yaw is very noisy,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,640
but it's free of drift,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,199
which means we can fuse it with integrated gyro measurements much

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,869
like how we fused accelerometer data with gyro data to measure roll and pitch.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,050
So the first question we need to answer is,

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,890
how does a magnetometer actually measure yaw?

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,765
The most high-level explanation goes something like this.

11
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:44,850
One, the Earth has a magnetic field that always points north.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,170
Two, a magnetometer measures magnetic fields.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,649
Three, if we know roll and pitch,

14
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,899
we can measure yaw by using the previous two facts along with a bit of math.

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,984
Facts one and two,

16
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:03,600
we're going to take for granted for our purposes.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,150
If you're interested in learning more about

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,990
magnetic fields or the physics underlying magnetometers,

19
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,304
we'll include links to some additional content below this video.

20
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:17,430
To understand the math of step three,

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,310
you can think of looking at it from above.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,090
So this is a bot pointing forward from this point of view,

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,674
and the Earth's magnetic field vector points like this.

24
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:31,228
And this vector is a three dimensional vector,

25
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,030
so it might be pointing towards the ground or away from the ground as well,

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,070
but we actually don't care about that.

27
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,459
What's important is that and in the x-y plane at least,

28
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,204
we know that the vector is pointing north.

29
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,549
So we can compare the vehicles forward direction to

30
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,840
magnetic north and we see that they differ by the amount psi,

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,135
which is equal to the yaw angle.

32
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:57,840
Now, the magnetometer that the vehicle has on board,

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,939
it's going to measure the x, y,

34
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,340
z components of the magnetic field vector in the vehicle's body frame,

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,870
so it will measure some x-component and some y-component and also some set component.

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,825
But since roll and pitch are zero in this case,

37
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,229
we don't have to care about that.

38
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,959
Now, you can see that the tangent of this yaw angle psi is

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,629
just the negative y component of the magnetic field divided by the x component.

40
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,995
So the yaw angle can be measured by just taking the arctan of these components.

41
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:41,545
This math was pretty straight forward only because we assumed roll and pitch were zero,

42
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:45,469
which let us ignore the set component of the measured field.

43
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,074
In the general case,

44
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,849
the math gets more complicated,

45
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,074
but conceptually, nothing really changes.

46
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:54,769
As long as you know roll and pitch,

47
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,080
you can use a magnetometer to measure yaw.
