1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,905
So, you've seen how to do dead-reckoning in some simple examples.

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:10,074
But how do we do the full 3D attitude update given gyro measurements?

3
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:12,609
If you remember from the control scores,

4
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:16,019
you can actually calculate the time derivative of

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,009
the Euler angles if we know the body rates and the current attitude.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,010
And since the body rates are what the gyroscopes measure directly,

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,005
this is a reasonable approach.

8
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,594
The key equation looks like this.

9
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:35,140
Here, you can see that the derivative of the Euler angles is given by

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,189
some matrix that depends on the vehicle's current attitude times the body rates p, q,

11
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,879
and r. Then if we want to get the Euler angles at time T,

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,700
it's just the Euler angles from time T minus one plus the derivative times delta

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,820
T. This numerical integration technique is called the Euler forward method,

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,945
and it's the simplest numerical integration that you can do.

15
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:07,359
There are other similar approaches out there as well but this one works very well.
