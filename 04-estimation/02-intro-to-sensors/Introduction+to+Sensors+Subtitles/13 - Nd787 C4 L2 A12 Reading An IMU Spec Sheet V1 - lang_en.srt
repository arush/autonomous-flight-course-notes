00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,325
At this point, you've seen how noise can corrupt our sensor measurements.

2
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:09,480
But really there are several different sources of error which corrupt

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,060
our measurements and the best way to correct

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,480
these errors is by understanding where they come from.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,385
So, with that in mind,

6
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:22,455
I want to show you a standard technical specification for an IMU sensor.

7
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:25,349
This is a real IMU spec sheet.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,920
There's a lot here,

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,495
but I just want to walk through some of it.

10
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:34,359
The first thing to remember is that an IMU is a digital sensor.

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:40,914
This IMU happens to have a 16-bit resolution for the accelerometer and the gyroscope.

12
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:44,725
The maximum resolution for this IMU is given for the

13
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:48,535
chiral as degrees per second and for the accelerometer,

14
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:51,054
it's given in milli g's.

15
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:57,549
So, one milli g is one 1,000's of the acceleration due to gravity.

16
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:03,265
Then these next three are some of the most important numbers on the spec sheet.

17
00:01:03,265 --> 00:01:07,439
This zero offset gives the bias of the sensors.

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,924
You can see for gyroscope the bias can be pretty big,

19
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:18,134
one degree per second can really add up and so we'll definitely need to correct for that.

20
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:20,594
Here we have TCO,

21
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:23,804
which stands for temperature calibration offset,

22
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:28,620
and you can see it's in units of milli g per Kelvin,

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,910
which makes this an acceleration per temperature.

24
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,939
So, this tells us how the bias of the sensor can actually change with temperature.

25
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,569
Then down here, we have the noise density,

26
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:48,599
and this has a funny unit of micro g's per square root of frequency.

27
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,419
To get the noise standard deviation,

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,510
this value is multiplied by the square root of

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,250
the cut-off frequency of

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,555
the low pass filter that you use to filter your measurement signal.

31
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:05,940
A good choice for that is 0.5 times the sampling rate.

32
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,590
So, if I had a sampling rate of 200 Hertz,

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,409
I'd have to multiply this number by 10,

34
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:19,534
the square root of 200 times 0.5 to get the noise standard deviation.

35
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:22,759
If I low-pass filter my signal more,

36
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,424
the noise goes down.

37
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:29,735
So, this datasheet already gives us some really interesting information.

38
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,270
We see that there's a bias,

39
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,810
there's also a temperature dependent bias,

40
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,640
and there's some random noise.
