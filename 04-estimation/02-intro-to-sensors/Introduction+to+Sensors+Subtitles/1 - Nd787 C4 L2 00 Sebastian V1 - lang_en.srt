00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Let me talk about your eyes,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,564
computer graphics, and computer vision.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:07,830
Every robot, every human being,

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,339
every animal perceives its world through what's called sensors.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,199
Your eyes are sensors. Your eyes

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,089
don't tell you whether your grandmother's in front of you.

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,675
Instead, it gives you maybe a set of receptive values or pixels of the surrounding scene.

8
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:24,285
And then your brain somehow is able to map into the state that you care about like,

9
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:25,710
am I facing my grandmother?

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,990
Same with robots. Robots have cameras.

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:29,099
They have magnetometers.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,345
They have accelerometers.

13
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:31,785
These are all sensors.

14
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:36,240
And the estimation problem robots face is to understand,

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,594
what is a state given these measurements?

16
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,500
We're going to do this using Bayes' rule,

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,350
which you are familiar with, and here's the interesting insight.

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,755
In Bayes' rule, you care about P of X given Z.

19
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,780
Z is your measurement, your image,

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,000
and X is the state you care about like,

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,590
is my grandmother in front of me?

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,440
But Bayes' rule turns this around in the opposite.

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,519
Bayes' rule says, let's compute a P of Z given X.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,130
Let's hypothesize, I'm facing my grandmother,

25
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,330
and then ask the question,

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,650
how likely is this image that I'm seeing right now under this hypothesis?

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
So in some sense, you solve the computer vision problem going from the image to

28
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,545
the state by implementing a computer graphics problem which is,

29
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:19,754
given the state, what is the likely image?

30
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:21,569
And the nice thing about this is,

31
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,434
the computer graphics problem is a physics problem.

32
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,810
It's a descriptive problem where sensors work.

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,100
So, all we have to do is we have to just model and

34
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,159
describe how sensors work in a forward way from

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,739
state to measurement and then we can use

36
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,119
Bayes' rule invert this for editing and come back to the state.
