00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
We talked a lot about rate gyros.

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:08,265
Now, let's talk about accelerometers and answer some very basic questions like,

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:10,650
how does an accelerometer work?

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,530
What does it measure?

5
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:17,369
You might be tempted to say that accelerometers measure acceleration,

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,575
but actually, they don't.

7
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:22,464
Think back to Newton's second law.

8
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:26,795
This law says that acceleration of a vehicle is equal to

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:32,010
one over the mass times the sum of all the forces acting on it.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,784
Unfortunately, accelerometers don't measure

11
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:39,494
total acceleration, but specific acceleration,

12
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:43,304
and specific acceleration is the acceleration that's caused

13
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:47,759
by all the forces acting on the vehicle except for gravity.

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,379
To understand why that is the case,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,120
we can look at a diagram for a simple accelerometer,

16
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,814
and this accelerometer consists of a proof mass that's attached

17
00:00:58,814 --> 00:01:04,004
inside of some housing and constrained so that it can only move vertically.

18
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:07,140
Now, this proof mass is a attached between the top

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,260
and bottom of the housing with two springs.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,094
And what the accelerometer is going to measure

21
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:15,719
is the difference between the upwards force

22
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,390
provided by the upper spring and the downwards force provided by the lower spring.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,140
So when the accelerometer is sitting on the table,

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,269
we know the proof mass has zero acceleration.

25
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:33,509
To achieve this, the NET force from the springs on the accelerometer is going

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,730
to be upwards and equal to the m times g rate of the proof mass.

27
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,420
And because the springs have to provide a NET force upwards that's equal to m times g,

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,945
this accelerometer would measure a NET acceleration

29
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:52,384
upwards that's equal to g. On the other hand,

30
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,520
if the sensor were in free fall,

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,045
the housing and the proof mass would accelerate

32
00:01:57,045 --> 00:02:00,695
downwards at 9.8 meters per second squared.

33
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:03,869
To keep the proof mass centered in the housing,

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,400
the two springs would be pulling equally so the NET force from the springs

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,534
would be zero and the accelerometer would measure zero acceleration.

36
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,810
So, this picture just shows one accelerometer.

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,254
A full three-axis accelerometer would need three of these in orthogonal directions,

38
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:27,824
and the output of a perfect three-axis accelerometer is

39
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:33,030
actually a measured a_accel that looks like this,

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,759
where this term is the total 3D force minus the force from gravity.

41
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,439
The accelerometers that we put on real drones are MEMS sensors,

42
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,000
but the physics underlying them is the same,

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,490
and this picture is still a helpful one to keep in mind when you try to

44
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,939
remember why accelerometers don't actually measure acceleration.
