1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
The magnetometer can be a tricky sensor to work with.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,759
There are a few reasons why this is the case,

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,509
but by far the biggest challenge you'll have is magnetometers

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,995
will come from local distortions of the Earth magnetic field.

5
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:17,594
The reason this is such a problem is pretty intuitive.

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:20,699
If this quadrotor is flying along

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,140
and then it measures a magnetic field that points this way,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,370
it's going to assume that this direction is north.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,550
But this assumption isn't always correct,

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,734
and there are two main explanations for these distortions to the Earth magnetic field.

11
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,780
The first is magnetic material which may be

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,035
mounted on the quadrotor, near the magnetometer.

13
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:46,169
In this case, the additional material will add

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,990
some constant bias to every magnetic field measurement.

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,969
So, this can actually be handled pretty easily through calibration.

16
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,384
The second cause of these distortions is magnetic material in the environment.

17
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:03,619
Other vehicles, buildings, bridges, power lines,

18
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,840
these can all have a significant effect as well,

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,765
and can't be addressed through calibration.

20
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:13,140
That means you have to treat them as noise.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,250
This makes magnetometer measurements really imprecise.

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,805
So how can we compensate for the systematic effects

23
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:24,305
that are constant with respect to the body frame?

24
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:29,340
For that, we can look at our standard sensor model with a bias,

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,620
a scaling matrix, and noise.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,520
The standard calibration routine is pretty interesting.

27
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,920
Basically, we keep the sensor in

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,254
one location so we know that the magnetic field stays the same,

29
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,459
and then we turn it around a lot.

30
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,625
So, imagine the tip of this pen points in the direction of the Earth magnetic field.

31
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,275
Then what we do is we turn the vehicle in

32
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:59,820
all these different orientations and measure the magnetic field at each one.

33
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,984
Now from your perspective,

34
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,689
you see the quadrotor rotating when I do this.

35
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,609
But in the quadrotor frame,

36
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:13,979
the vehicle is stationary and it's the magnetic field vector that's rotating.

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,485
You can imagine the tip of this measured magnetic field vector should trace out

38
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:25,400
a perfect sphere if the magnetometer is working

39
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,235
correctly and if we cover enough orientations during calibration.

40
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,365
But instead of getting a sphere,

41
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,210
it turns out that what we actually measure is

42
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,530
some 3D ellipse which may not be centered at the origin.

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,689
It's a little easier to visualize this in two dimensions.

44
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,030
In 2D, we expect the magnetic fields to

45
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,689
trace out a circle instead of a sphere as we rotate.

46
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,379
We are going to normalize everything.

47
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:57,400
The magnitude of the magnetic field is not important here.

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,335
So, we expect this magnetic field circle to have a radius of one,

49
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,840
and it should be centered at the origin.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,705
Now, let's imagine actually doing this calibration routine.

51
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:14,840
The magnetic field we measure may look something like this,

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,245
and this measured magnetic field clearly has bias since it isn't centered on the origin.

53
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:29,300
It also has some non-zero scaling matrix since it's too small and a bit stretched.

54
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,335
But that's fine, because that's the whole point of calibration.

55
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:36,439
After performing this routine and then doing

56
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,889
least scales to get the bias and the scaling matrix,

57
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,309
we would be able to transform our real measurements,

58
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,159
so that they match what we expected.
