1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,645
How does our uncertainty estimate propagate?

2
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:07,529
We know how accurately we can measure the turn rate,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,919
but what does that mean for our angle estimates?

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,699
So, if we use a very basic integration scheme,

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,629
and we neglect that we have additional integration error epsilon,

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,924
how does the noise in the turn rate measurements affect our angle estimates?

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,859
We can go step-by-step through that.

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,009
For example, Theta at time one is equal to our initial Theta,

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,945
plus our measured turn rate,

10
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,704
which is the true turn rate, Omega zero,

11
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:42,364
plus some noise representation Eta zero times delta t. So,

12
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:44,385
if we go through the equation,

13
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,549
we see that Theta one is corrupted by

14
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,559
some noise that has a variance of Sigma square, delta t square,

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,560
and that's because if I have a Gaussian or

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,730
any random variable and I multiply it by a number,

17
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,279
the variance is the original variance,

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,155
times the number squared.

19
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:07,109
So, this tells us how the noise in

20
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,864
the turn rate measurement translates into noise in the angle estimate,

21
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,935
and then, we can continue that for Theta two.

22
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:23,314
If we do that, we see that the noise variance in the angle is two times delta t square,

23
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:29,334
Sigma square, because now we have Eta zero, plus Eta one.

24
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:32,324
Assuming these are independent,

25
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:36,600
the variances of those two random variables add.

26
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,228
So, the overall variance doubles,

27
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,189
and then with every step, it increases.

28
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,685
So, if you look at the nth time step Theta n,

29
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:52,480
then our variance related to our estimate of Theta n

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,784
is n times delta t square, times Sigma square.

31
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:02,129
That means that our uncertainty about our angle estimate grows over time.

32
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,060
Of course, we can reduce this uncertainty by taking

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,990
fossil measurements which will lower delta t. But this n means that no matter what we do,

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,920
the uncertainty will have to grow with time.

35
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,679
Now, I can make a plot of angle on the vertical axis and show that over time.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,319
If we assumes zero turn rate,

37
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,185
then our angle will be constant over time.

38
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:32,278
But because we have measurement noise in our turn rate measurement,

39
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,259
the uncertainty envelope cross,

40
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:40,034
and plotted like this as a plus minus three Sigma envelope,

41
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:45,419
you can see that the width of this uncertainty grows with the square root of time.

42
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,534
So, this is really problematic because over time, our uncertainty grows.

43
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:54,930
Which means our knowledge of the true angle decreases.

44
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,230
Luckily, there are some other techniques that we can

45
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,949
use to tame this increasing uncertainty.

46
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,129
But if you use dead-reckoning alone,

47
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,960
you will always have this growing uncertainty.
