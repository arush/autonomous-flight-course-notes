00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
The last sensor I want to talk about is the barometer.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,550
The barometer can give very precise measurements of altitude,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,225
but these measurements are highly susceptible to drift.

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:16,559
Because of this, the barometer is a good compliment to the GPS,

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,309
which makes noisy but drift-free measurements of altitude.

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,479
So how does a barometer actually measure altitude?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,085
Well, the barometer doesn't actually measure altitude directly.

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:33,674
Instead, a barometer works by measuring atmospheric pressure.

9
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:38,125
Atmospheric pressure decreases in a predictable way with altitude.

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:43,454
And this means that a measurement of pressure can be used as an estimate of height.

11
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:47,210
And barometers are small and inexpensive.

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,859
You can buy one for about a dollar.

13
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,575
And if you'll look into a MEMS barometer,

14
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,780
they are really pretty simple.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,255
Basically, you have two metal plates that are separated by a vacuum gap.

16
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:05,049
Air pressure pushes down on the upper plate and this causes

17
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:10,530
deformations which cause the electrical capacitance of the two plates to change.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,500
We can measure this change in capacitance.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,084
And from that, we can know the air pressure.

20
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:22,619
Here, you can see a PCB with a GPS and accelerometer,

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,025
a gyroscope, a compass, and a barometer.

22
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:28,140
And in the middle of the barometer,

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,689
you can see there's a tiny hole.

24
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,569
That hole is there so air can get in and push against the plate.

25
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,514
You can imagine that it would be pretty easy to corrupt

26
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:44,430
the measurements the sensor makes by blowing into this hole.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,985
So we have to be careful to avoid propeller down wash

28
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:51,795
and wind as sources of error we use a barometer.

29
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:55,965
This is done by properly shielding the sensor.

30
00:01:55,965 --> 00:02:01,064
So how do we use measurements of air pressure to get altitude?

31
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:07,590
This equation is the atmospheric model we use to get altitude from a barometer.

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,909
h_b is the height of the barometer and h_s is the height of some reference point.

33
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,223
So we really need a reference point in order to use a barometer,

34
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:21,674
and usually, the reference point is near the surface.

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,070
So h_s is the height of that reference point and

36
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,334
T_s and P_s of a temperature and pressure at that height.

37
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:32,010
P_b is the pressure measured by

38
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,120
the barometer and all the other values are simply constants.
