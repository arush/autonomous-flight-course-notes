00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
For the final project of this course,

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,919
you'll be implementing a 3D state estimation algorithm in C++.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,275
In the first part of this lesson,

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:16,875
we discussed some of the decisions we made around how that 3D estimation will take place.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,219
In particular we discussed how we would maintain

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,285
an estimate of all the vehicles 12 state variables,

7
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:29,115
and the decision we decided to use involved two filters.

8
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:32,449
One filter is called a complimentary filter,

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,000
and it uses direct measurements of pitch and

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,509
roll from the IMU to estimate the vehicles attitude.

11
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:40,504
This worked by balancing

12
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:44,960
the long-term liability of the accelerometers attitude measurement,

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,109
with the more responsive but drift-prone measurements

14
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,589
that come from the IMU's Rate Gyros.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,130
The majority of the state estimation was handled by an extended Kalman filter.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,359
This EKF was conceptually very similar to any other EKF,

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,740
though the Jacobians did get larger and more complicated.

18
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,209
In the second half of this lesson,

19
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,279
you learned about the unscented Kalman filter,

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,260
and you saw how the UKF handles non-linear g and h functions,

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,795
not by linearizing the frictions,

22
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:23,560
but instead by approximating the Gaussian distribution,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,984
which represented the vehicle state.

24
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:29,890
The UKF makes this approximation by selecting

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,820
special samples from the distribution called "sigma points".

26
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,339
Once we had the sigma points,

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,230
we could do prediction for instance,

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,454
by simply passing these sigma points through the state transition function g. Then,

29
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:48,700
when we wanted to turn these predicted sigmas back into a Gaussian,

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,960
we simply calculated the mean and covariance of these sample points.

31
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,279
One thing I hope you take away from this lesson,

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,638
is that there are many ways to do state estimation,

33
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:03,935
and often there isn't a single best way.

34
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,765
In the rest of this course,

35
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:07,750
you'll learn a bit more about some of

36
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,379
the practical considerations associated with state estimation,

37
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:14,528
as well as some techniques for estimating state,

38
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:17,520
when you don't have access to GPS.
