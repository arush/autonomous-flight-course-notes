00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
Welcome back. This lesson is going to be broken into two parts.

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:05,750
In the first part,

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,339
we're going to do a conceptual walk-through of

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,684
the 3D state estimator that you're going to implement in C++ for your final project.

5
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:18,240
As we do this, you'll also be implementing some of the logic in Python.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,073
Once we've gone through 3D state estimation,

7
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,970
there's one more variant of the Kalman filter that I'm

8
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,594
going to show you called the unscented Kalman filter.

9
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,919
The unscented Kalman filter is

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,310
an even fancier math trick than the extended Kalman filter,

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,725
but it actually winds up being easier to implement than the EKF,

12
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,265
and it works better too.

13
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:42,545
But we'll get more into the EKF at the end of the lesson.

14
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:47,215
For now, let's focus on the moment we've all been waiting for,

15
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:52,480
implementing state estimation in three dimensions on a real drone.
