1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
So, now just to make your life a little bit messier,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,410
we are going to go to a real drone,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,100
and the real drone will have a seven dimensional state-space to load,

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,879
and the robot will now navigate in a 3D space, okay.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,350
So, what this does to you is makes these matrices,

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,844
the [inaudible] matrices much, much more messy.

7
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:21,589
We're going to do Kalman filters, extended Kalman filter,

8
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,420
and then there's a technique called unscented Kalman filter,

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,570
which is my favorite technique. Why unscented?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,769
Many years ago in Sydney, in Professor Durant Whyte's lab,

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,810
there were students that hated the unscented Kalman filter.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,575
It's so hard to implement,

13
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,030
and it's smallest amount of error [inaudible] estimator.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,785
This filter stinks.

15
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:44,109
They came up with a technique that's easier to

16
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,615
implement and works much better in practice,

17
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,905
and called it the unscented Kalman filter.

18
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:50,880
That's why it's called unscented.
