00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,855
The Unscented Kalman Filter, or UKF,

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:08,804
doesn't try to have a linear approximation for the g or h function.

3
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:13,580
Instead, it approximates the probability distribution itself.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,070
So, if this is our distribution,

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,390
a UKF would select a small set of weighted sample points such that the mean and

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,240
covariance of these weighted points is

7
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,864
equal to the mean and covariance of the distribution.

8
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:32,234
These special points are called sigma points.

9
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:35,769
The UKF propagates the small set of

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,055
weighted points through the non-linear g or h function.

11
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:45,284
Then we can calculate the mean and covariance of the transformed sigma points

12
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:51,140
and just use these empirical values as the mean and covariance of the new state estimate.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,880
But, where do these special sigma points come from?

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,140
Naively, we might just say,

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,149
more points must be better,

16
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,614
and select as many points as we possibly can.

17
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,480
This brute force approach could work,

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,655
but it could be computationally prohibitive pretty quickly.

19
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:15,754
The real magic behind the UKF is what's called the Unscented Transform,

20
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:21,579
and the first step of the Unscented Transform is getting these special sigma points.
