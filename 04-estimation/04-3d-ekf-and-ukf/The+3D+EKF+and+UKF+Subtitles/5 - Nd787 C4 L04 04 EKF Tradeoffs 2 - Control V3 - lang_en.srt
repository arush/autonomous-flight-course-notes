1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
Next, I want to discuss our choice of control input.

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:06,299
Our control input is not going to be

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,919
the collective thrust and three moments that you worked with in the controls course.

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,949
Instead, we're going to be using the X, Y,

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,609
and Z accelerations as well as the R rate psi.

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,300
Considering what we chose to use as a state vector,

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,214
this makes some sense to use as a control input if we can.

8
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,579
But I want you to really look at this for a

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,359
second and think back to the controls course as you do.

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,655
Are we allowed to do this?

11
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:39,320
Can we just say we're going to use the acceleration and the R rate as our control input?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,798
Remember, that the thing we get to control are the rotation rates of the propellers,

13
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:50,079
and these map directly to one collective thrust and three moments.

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,134
Shouldn't those be our control inputs?

15
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:57,054
The answer is yes we could and usually do

16
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:01,344
use the real control commands as the control vector in our estimator,

17
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:04,314
but we certainly don't have to do that.

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,780
So, how do we do this?

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,665
How do we use the accelerations and psi.

20
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,540
as a control input?

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,200
We're actually going to handle this using a weird trick.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,379
These control inputs are actually going to come from the IMU measurements.

23
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,489
The accelerations will come from

24
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:26,299
the accelerometer on the inertial measurement unit, and psi.

25
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,465
will come from the Rate Gyro.

26
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, the right thing to do would be to use the IMU for measurements since well,

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,015
it's a sensor, but many sources actually use the IMU as a control input.

28
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,359
One reason this is the case is that for lower cost terms,

29
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,125
the control commands don't always

30
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,724
accurately reflect the controls that actually get executed,

31
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:55,219
while the measurements made by the IMU actually do reflect reality.

32
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,814
So, because the IMU directly measures these accelerations,

33
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:02,245
and acceleration is in some sense

34
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:04,910
what you're controlling when you're moving the drone around,

35
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,245
we can justify using the IMU as our control input.

36
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:11,960
We could of course use the IMU as a measurement,

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,469
and use the commanded controls as the control input.

38
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,609
But the tradeoff is if you use the IMU as a measurement,

39
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,930
you have to put a lot more stuff into the state vector,

40
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,280
and those Jacobians get even bigger.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,169
I encourage you to discuss this decision on the Slack channels,

42
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,659
and if you're feeling ambitious,

43
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,000
you can even try to implement an estimator using a different strategy on your own
