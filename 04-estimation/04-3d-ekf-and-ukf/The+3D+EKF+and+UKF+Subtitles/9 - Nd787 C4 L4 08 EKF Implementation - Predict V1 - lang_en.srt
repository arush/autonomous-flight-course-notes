1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
Now, as always, to implement the predict step,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,629
we need a state-transition function.

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,779
That G function looks like this,

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:15,000
and this is the portion of the prediction that's based on the previous state.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,850
And here, we have the position updates and here are the velocity updates,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,730
which incorporate the acceleration due to gravity.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,234
Now, over here, we have the portion of the prediction that's based on the control input.

8
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:33,244
The notation I'm using here is meant to keep things a little cleaner.

9
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:36,794
So, when I write Rbg 0 colon,

10
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,929
that means that these three missing elements of

11
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:46,314
this matrix should be replaced with the first row of the rotation matrix.

12
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:51,814
So, this is just rotating the body-frame accelerations into the world frame.

13
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,789
The important thing to note here is that this

14
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,655
is exactly where our nonlinearities come in.

15
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:06,109
Because this rotation matrix contains non-linear functions of V, theta, and sin.

16
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:09,450
So, this one is just here to pluck out

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,534
the change in yaw angle given in the control input.

18
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:15,965
So, that's G. To do prediction,

19
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:18,219
we will need a G prime as well,

20
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,804
which means we have to take the Jacobian.

21
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:25,065
When we do that, we get a lot of zeros, which is good,

22
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:31,424
and we get ones along the diagonal and also some delta Ts.

23
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:37,319
The only tricky partial derivatives are here in these three elements of the Jacobian.

24
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,194
I want to point out that I didn't even take this derivative, I looked it up.

25
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,119
The math gets pretty messy,

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,900
but you wind up getting this matrix,

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,790
R prime, and the Jacobian winds up looking like this.

28
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,350
This notation is telling you to take the dot product of

29
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:02,134
the first row of R prime with the first three elements of the control vector.

30
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:08,759
So, with that, it should be possible to implement the predict step of the 3D EKF.
