1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Now that we have the complimentary filter implemented,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,695
you should be able to estimate the roll and the pitch in the global frame.

3
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:11,070
So, we're just going to assume that's happening all the time,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,765
and we just know roll and pitch now as a result of that estimation process.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:21,440
Now, I like to walk through some of the actual EKF implementation details.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,400
We'll be providing you with a document that goes over all of this in detail,

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,419
and you may find that more useful than listening to me explain everything,

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,175
but let's walk through that document as well.

9
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:37,594
So, here I am in the section called three dimensional quad.

10
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:42,899
Now, in the event that we make some changes to this document after I record this,

11
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,949
it's worth noting that some of the details of what you see here may change.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,770
So, things like the section and equation numbers that you see in this video might change.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,090
I also want to mention that there's a lot of math here,

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,275
and it's possible that there are some mistakes in the draft I'm recording with here.

15
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:02,699
If we find mistakes,

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,909
we will make sure to update the document that we distribute.

17
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,879
So, if you have any doubts just make sure you consult the document.

18
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:12,364
With that out of the way, let's dive in.

19
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,259
As I already mentioned,

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,734
we're representing the state at time t with these variables,

21
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:23,150
and the control input at time t with these variables.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,780
This control input will be getting from the IMU which is weird, but it works.

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,079
Note the superscript B and all of these variables

24
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,739
which indicates that these are given in the body frame.

25
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:38,140
Since these are in the body frame,

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:44,170
we need a rotation matrix that converts from the body frame to the world or global frame,

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,239
and that should look pretty familiar.
