00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,203
Now that we know how to implement state estimation in 3D,

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:08,400
let's move on to the second part of this lesson where I will

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,970
introduce you to another variant of the Kalman Filter,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,649
called the unscented Kalman filter before I do that,

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,919
let's do a quick recap of Kalman filters.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,030
A Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm that can be

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,995
used to estimate the state of a system that cannot be measured directly.

8
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:36,730
A Kalman filter is defined for a linear system with a linear state transition model,

9
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,444
and a linear measurement model.

10
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:42,865
But this is a very specific situation.

11
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,940
In general both the state-transition function

12
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:49,254
and the measurement function could be non-linear.

13
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:52,895
I want to demonstrate this difference with a picture.

14
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:57,180
The Kalman filter assumes a Gaussian distribution.

15
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,840
When the state transition function or the measurement function is linear,

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,094
and we pass the state into the transition function,

17
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:07,429
the distribution stays Gaussian,

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,295
even though the mean and covariance will have changed.

19
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:14,954
But when the transition function is non-linear,

20
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:18,524
the resulting distribution will not be Gaussian.

21
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:22,560
The extended Kalman filter handles this by first

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,045
linearizing the system around the mean of the current estimate,

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,840
then the EKF uses linear approximations of

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
the state transition and measurement functions to update its estimate.

25
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,935
So, this works well when the G or

26
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:42,060
H function can be well approximated by a linear function,

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,480
but there are some drawbacks to EKFs.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,950
Consider what happens when the state transition function looks like this.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,799
In this region, the function is not well represented by a linear approximation at all.

30
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,989
This is one situation where unscented Kalman filters are really useful
