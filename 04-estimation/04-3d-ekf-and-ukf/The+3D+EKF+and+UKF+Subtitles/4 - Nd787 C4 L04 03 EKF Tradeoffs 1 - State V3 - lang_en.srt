1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
At this point, I want to emphasize that there's more than one way

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,425
to do an EKF for a quad in three-dimensions.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,394
Every approach has to make some trade-offs.

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:12,539
Even in the design of this course,

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,375
we had a lot of discussion about the best way to do it.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,850
The approach we ultimately chose is one reasonable option,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,830
but it's not the only option and it's also not necessarily the best option.

8
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,714
The option we chose is the result of trade-offs between

9
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:34,560
implementation complexity, explainability, and functionality.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,340
The two choices I want to explain are our choice of EKF state vector and input.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,945
Almost everything else is a consequence of these two decisions.

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,664
So, first our choice of EKF state vector.

13
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,619
What we're going to do is use something called a complimentary filter for attitude,

14
00:00:54,619 --> 00:01:01,320
direct gyro measurements for the body rates and an EKF for position, velocity, and yeah.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
So, our EKF state vector is going to look like this.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
You could also choose to not put roll and pitch in the complimentary filter,

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,329
you could put it as part of the EKF state as well.

18
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,814
Then you could do all your estimation within EKF.

19
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:20,280
But if you had the full pose in the EKF,

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,290
then you would have something like a 15 or 16 dimensional-state vector and then 15 by 15,

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,530
or 16 by 16 Jacobians.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,260
People do that, but it's a lot to keep track of and it gets hard to debug.

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,365
So, we chose something that's a little simpler for this course.

24
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:42,060
You won't get quite as good an estimate when you put attitude into a separate filter,

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,079
but it will still work for typical flight and it's a very common thing to do as well.
