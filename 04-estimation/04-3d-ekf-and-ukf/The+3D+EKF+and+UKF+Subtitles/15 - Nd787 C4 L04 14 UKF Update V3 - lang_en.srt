1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
The UKF update is a little more involved,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,500
but let me just walk through the algorithm at a high level.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,330
So, first note that the update function takes the sigma points as input,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,175
along with the new measurement as we'd expect.

5
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:18,074
And the first thing we do is recover

6
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:22,725
the updated mean and the co-variance from these weighted sigma points.

7
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:28,310
Next, we take the sigma points and pass them through the observation function.

8
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:33,629
So, just like we pass the sigma points through the state transition function earlier,

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,590
now we pass them through the observation function and this gives us new sigma points.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,670
And this basically gives us

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,380
an expected observation that's represented as the Z sub t sigma points.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,040
Then, we can compute a mu_Z and sigma

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,829
Z of the sigma points that we passed through the observation function.

14
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,189
And we do this using the same technique that we use

15
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,579
to compute the mu bar and sigma bar before.

16
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,894
We just take the weighted sample mean and sample co-variance of the Z sigma points.

17
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,964
And we need one more thing,

18
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:13,540
which is the cross co-variance between

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,260
the state sigma points and the observation sigma points,

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,630
and this tells us how they vary with respect to each other.

21
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:24,719
And then we use this to calculate the Kalman gain.

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,909
And once we have the Kalman gain,

23
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,530
it is just like with a common filter.

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,870
We just use the mean that we got from

25
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,250
our predicted sigma points and then we add some correction in the direction of

26
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,129
the measurement and that correction is just the common gain

27
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:44,659
times our measurement Z sub t minus our predicted observation,

28
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,530
which is represented as the mean of those sigma points.

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,689
Then, we do something similar here to get the new updated co-variance,

30
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,524
and finally we can return our new mean and co-variance,

31
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,300
and then we just rinse and repeat,

32
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,634
and as with any other base filter,

33
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,000
we just alternate back and forth between

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,680
prediction and measurement, prediction and measurement.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Now, I want to talk about the trade offs between EKF's and UKF's.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,625
For the EKF's, we had to take all these derivatives to compute the jacobian matrix.

37
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,444
For the UKF, no derivatives.

38
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:28,329
For this reason, the UKF is substantially easier to implement.

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,780
All we need is a G and an H function.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,349
Not only is the UKF easier,

41
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,479
but the UKF almost always gives a better state estimate than the EKF,

42
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,854
and it does so in a comparable runtime.

43
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,590
So, given a choice,

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,860
you should almost always use a UKF if the system is at all gaussian.

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,710
Given that that's true,

46
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,344
why did we spent all that time covering EKFs?

47
00:02:55,344 --> 00:03:00,055
And why are we asking you to implement an EKF for the final project?

48
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,760
The answer is that EKF's are the standard tool in

49
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,384
the field and you will certainly encounter them in your work.

50
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:11,049
So, we wanted to make sure you understood them completely,

51
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,600
but we're also aware of the UKF advantages over the EKF.
