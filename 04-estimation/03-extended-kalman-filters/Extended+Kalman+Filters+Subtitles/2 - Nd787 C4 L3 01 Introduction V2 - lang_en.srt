00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Welcome back, I'd like to introduce you to

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,339
your instructor for the next two lessons, Stefanie Tellex.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,960
Thanks, it's great to be here.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,310
And it's great to have you here.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,695
So, should we explain what this lesson is all about?

6
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,290
Yeah, well, so far in this course,

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,629
you've learned a lot about making measurements and

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,344
incorporating those measurements into your state estimator.

9
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:20,559
That's right. But up until this point,

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,129
we've had to assume that the vehicle wasn't moving,

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,234
and state estimation for a stationary vehicle just isn't that useful.

12
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,719
So in this lesson,

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,679
you'll learn how we can use something called a Kalman filter, and later,

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,155
an extended Kalman filter to incorporate

15
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,759
the controls we command the vehicle into our state estimator.
