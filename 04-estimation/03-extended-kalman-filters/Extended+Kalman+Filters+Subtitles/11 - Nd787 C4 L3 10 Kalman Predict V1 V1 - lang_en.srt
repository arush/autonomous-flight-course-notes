1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,044
When you look at the Kalman filter pseudo code,

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,415
the predict function looks like this.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:09,240
Now, instead of taking some arbitrary belief,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,660
it just takes the mean and covariance from

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,504
t minus one along with the current control input.

6
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:19,529
And because everything is Gaussian,

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,750
the integral from the base filter takes a nice closed form and I can compute

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,899
the new Gaussian by taking the old mean and

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,664
passing it through the state transition function we just defined.

10
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,004
And that gives us a new mean,

11
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,020
and to update the covariance,

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,480
I first have to use this g prime function to get this matrix G sub t. And then I

13
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,140
use this G sub t to transform

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,820
the old covariance and then here add what's called the Process noise.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,049
So this Q term is why the new covariance is always going to be bigger after prediction.

16
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,753
Now that I've propagated my mean and covariance,

17
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,799
I can return those from prediction.

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,125
Before you try to implement this,

19
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:11,295
there's one more thing I want to say about this g prime function.

20
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:14,075
I choose to write the pseudo code this way,

21
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,530
because it makes the pseudo code for

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,450
the Kalman filter identical to the extended Kalman filter.

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,189
But really this is a bit of overkill when we're just doing Kalman filters.

24
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,679
When we talk about the EKF,

25
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,620
you'll see this g prime is actually what's called

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,620
the Jacobian of the state transition function;

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,650
which you can think of as the derivative of

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,315
the state transition function with respect to the state.

29
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,230
And for a Kalman filter,

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,564
where everything is linear,

31
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:47,474
remember we could break the state transition function

32
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,344
down into this A times x plus B times u.

33
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:55,620
So the derivative of this function with respect to x is actually

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,775
just this A matrix in the case of a Kalman filter.

35
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,865
So g prime will just look like this.

36
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:10,349
So even though in the pseudo code here says the g prime is a function of u and x,

37
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,794
it turns out that for the linear case,

38
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:19,294
g prime actually ignores these inputs and just returns that same A matrix every time.

39
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:22,049
That won't be the case when things become

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,160
non-linear and we switch to the extended Kalman Filter.
