00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875
Let's talk about Kalman filters.

2
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,650
Kalman filters were invented by Rudolf Kalman in the 1950s.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,270
Although technically speaking, there were

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,625
two other folks who did this before him, long forgotten.

5
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,230
I think Thielen Starling.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,560
Never mind. Kalman filters allow you to integrate measurements and

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,359
controls in a continuous space to find this continuous state estimate.

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,210
We're going to code our first Kalman filter here and for non-linear systems,

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,960
as you'll see, we're going to build what's called an extended Kalman filter.
