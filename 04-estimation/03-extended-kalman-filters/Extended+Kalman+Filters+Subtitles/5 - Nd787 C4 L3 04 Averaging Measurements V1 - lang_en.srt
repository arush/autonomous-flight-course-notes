1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
You just saw that using noisy sensor measurements directly is a bad idea.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,310
Even if the vehicle is at a target altitude,

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:13,350
a single noisy measurement might report a height that's way too high or way too low.

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,245
This leads to some pretty erratic control.

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:20,655
So, what we're going to do in this lesson, is something magical.

6
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:24,765
We're going to use these noisy measurements that are wrong,

7
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,570
to somehow get an estimate of the state of

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,769
the vehicle that winds up being really close to the truth.

9
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,195
The way we're going to do this is by exploiting two tricks.

10
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:41,130
The first trick is that we get to read the sensor lots and lots of times,

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,300
not just one time.

12
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,169
When we intelligently average lots of measurements,

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,690
we'll get a better estimate of our state.

14
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,979
The second trick is that we know what we've told the drone to

15
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,404
do and we can actually predict the effects of our control actions.

16
00:00:57,405 --> 00:01:00,585
So when we tell the drone to accelerate upwards,

17
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:04,620
we can incorporate our knowledge of the vehicle's dynamics into

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,820
our estimate without having to wait for a sensor to give us new measurements.

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,889
But before we get to that,

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,754
let's just do a quick notation recap.

21
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:19,500
For now, we're going to think of time discretely and we're going to be using x of t to

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,099
represent the drone's true and unknowable state at timestep t. For a one day drone,

23
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,280
that will be the altitude and its rate of change,

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,599
and we're going to use z sub t to represent an observation or

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,919
the measurement that we get at timestep t. For the one the drone,

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,859
that would just be an altitude measurement that comes

27
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,295
from some range sensor that's pointed down at the ground.

28
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:48,390
To represent our estimate of the state at time t,

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,909
we're going to use x hats of t. The simplest thing we can do to get

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,819
a reasonable estimate from noisy data is to

31
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,359
just average all of the observations together.

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,510
In that case, x hat would just be the sum of all the t sensor measurements divided

33
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,569
by t. But we would like to not have to save all z's of t's.

34
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,989
The first problem with doing that is that our memory grows without

35
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,710
bound because we're going to have to save all the z's of t's.

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,530
The second problem is that the time this is going to take it's longer and longer,

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,159
the longer the drone has been running.
