1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,464
So, we want to avoid having to save

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:07,559
our entire history of sensor measurements to perform our update.

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:09,539
Luckily that's not so hard.

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,399
What we're going to do is transform this into a recursive update,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,615
where we take our old x_hat and our new z_sub_t and use those to get a new x_hat,

6
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:23,804
and the equation looks like this.

7
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:27,059
We've replaced the history of t minus

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,869
one sensor measurements with a single number, their average.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,484
And then we multiply that by t minus one,

10
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,170
and then add it in the new measurement and then we divide

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,260
by t. And this is so much better.

12
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,250
This approach respects something called the "Markov Assumption",

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,015
and basically that just means that our updated estimate

14
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:52,350
only depends on the current observation and the previous estimate.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,060
It doesn't depend on

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,010
all the previous observations we used to come up with that previous estimate.

17
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,515
A lot of what we do in estimation,

18
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:03,450
is trying to get problems into

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,515
this Markov form so that we can exploit this computational advantage.

20
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:13,469
But unfortunately, even though this approach is computationally better,

21
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,069
when we try to use those we're going to run into another problem.

22
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,250
As t gets bigger new measurements are

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,325
going to cause the estimate to change less and less.

24
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:27,390
So this will be really bad for a drone that hovers in place for

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,500
a long time and then after a long time decides to move.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,689
The motion will take a long time to get incorporated into the estimate.

27
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,719
We can attempt to address this by implementing an exponential moving average like this.

28
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,280
This would definitely make the vehicle more responsive to new measurements,

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,560
but it might suffer the same problems that you saw when using raw measurements.
