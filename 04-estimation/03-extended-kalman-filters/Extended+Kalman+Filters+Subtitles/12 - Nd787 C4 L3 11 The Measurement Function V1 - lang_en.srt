1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,589
We can't just predict forever to get

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:06,774
the state estimate because the transition noise is always increasing.

3
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:08,275
And after each step,

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,780
it's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:16,239
If we had a perfect transition model with no noise,

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,509
then this wouldn't happen and we can just predict forever,

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,804
and we wouldn't need to make any measurements.

8
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,934
But in fact, there is noise,

9
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,334
so we do need to use measurements.

10
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:30,130
Just like we defined our state-transition function, g,

11
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,614
for the predict step,

12
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,545
we're going to need it to define a measurement model,

13
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,715
h, for the update step.

14
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:42,350
And this 1D drone has one sensor which is a range sensor pointing downwards,

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,655
which measures the height of the drone above the ground.

16
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:50,179
So what the measurement model does is it takes a state as

17
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,750
input and returns the measurement we'd expect to see from a perfect sensor.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,674
So if we pass in a state which is z. and z,

19
00:00:59,674 --> 00:01:02,929
then we want the measurement to just pick out the z value,

20
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,094
since that's what our ideal height sensor would do.

21
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:09,694
And the matrix that does this just looks like this.

22
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,949
And once again, everything is linear so I can write

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,880
the h function as this matrix C times x.

24
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,694
So now, we have our measurement model, h. Now,

25
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:24,625
if we go back to the pseudocode for the Bayes' Filter,

26
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:29,239
the measurement is incorporated in this update function where I

27
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,584
get my belief after prediction bel bar and I get my measurement z_sub_t.

28
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:40,594
And then, I use Bayes rule to incorporate the measurement with my predicted state.

29
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,769
For a Kalman filter,

30
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,839
which is just an implementation of a Bayes filter,

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,719
the measurement update looks a little different.
