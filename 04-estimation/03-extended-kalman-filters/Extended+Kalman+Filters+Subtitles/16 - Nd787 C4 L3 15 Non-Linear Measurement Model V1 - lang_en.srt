1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Before we can dive into the measurement update step,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,825
we need to talk about this drones sensor.

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:13,664
So, here is our drone and remember it's only allowed to rotate and move left and right.

4
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:16,184
Over here we are going to imagine there is

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,174
a big vertical wall at some position wall sub y,

6
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,435
and this wall extends infinitely upwards and downwards.

7
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:27,449
We are going to give this drone a range sensor that

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,855
points to the right and measures the distance to this wall.

9
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:34,905
So, when the drones rule angle phi is equal to zero,

10
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:39,539
we'd expect this sensor to give us a measured value of wall sub y,

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,004
minus the drones y position, x of y.

12
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:46,365
If we let the drone rule to some angle phi,

13
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:50,835
then we'd expect the sensor to return some number that's bigger than wall sub y,

14
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:52,454
minus x sub y.

15
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,934
In fact, we'd expect it to return wall sub y,

16
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,225
minus x sub y,

17
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,760
divided by the cosine of phi,

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,594
and this is our measurement model.

19
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:06,659
This function h takes in a state as input,

20
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,950
and returns an expected value of what the sensor will read.

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,299
Keep in mind, this really does just return and expected value.

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,314
The sensor is of course noisy.

23
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:21,204
This measurement model is really useful.

24
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:24,674
Even though I said it takes the true state as input,

25
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:28,905
we could also pass it in estimate of the state and then figure out

26
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:33,570
what we expect the measurement to be based on our current estimate.

27
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,734
Now this h function has a cosine in it.

28
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,953
So, clearly, it's non-linear,

29
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:44,224
and that means that if we want to use the measurement model in an extended Kalman Filter,

30
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:49,079
we're going to have to linearise the model around the current state.
