1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Now that we have this non-linear measurement model,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,629
we can derive h prime which is the Jacobian of the measurement model.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,630
Since our measurement model is just a one-by-one matrix,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,054
this will be less involved than the Jacobian for the state transition function.

5
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,460
So the Jacobian will be the derivative of

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,730
the measurement model with respect to the state vector,

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,149
and that's going to give us a one one three matrix whose elements are,

8
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:34,015
the partial derivative of H with respect to the phi component of the state vector.

9
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:39,784
The partial derivative of H with respect to the y.component and the state vector,

10
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:45,949
and the partial derivative of H with respect to the y component of the state vector,

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,205
and when you do the math the Jacobian winds up looking like this.

12
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:54,739
So how does the measurement model H and its Jacobian h prime,

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,050
get used in the update step?

14
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,529
Here in the update function the first thing we do is

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,219
use h prime to generate the H sub t matrix.

16
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:08,230
Then we've got some messy math in the Kalman gain calculations,

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,814
and then when we update the mean we compare

18
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:15,329
the actual measurement Z to the expected measurement H of mu bar,

19
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:18,734
and this is all just like it was in the linear Kalman filter.

20
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,859
So now that you have H and h prime,

21
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,000
you should be able to implement the update step for this extended Kalman filter.
