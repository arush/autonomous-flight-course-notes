1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,294
As you've seen earlier in this course,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,339
sensors are not perfect.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,925
And we can capture the imperfections in a sensor using something

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:13,650
called a measurement model which tells us p of z given x.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,199
That is, the probability of making some measurement, for example,

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,589
with the rain sensor,

7
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,129
given a certain state,

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,449
for example, how far the drone really is above the ground.

9
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,905
And often, these measurement models are Gaussian.

10
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:29,679
The most likely measurement is centered around

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,835
the true value of whatever the sensor measures,

12
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,350
but there's some covariance as well.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,890
In the next exercise,

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,170
you'll simulate noisy measurements and see what happens when you try to

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,760
use those noisy measurements directly to control a 1D drone.
