1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
For a general Bayes filter,

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,370
the measurement update look like this.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,580
But for calming filters,

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,289
the measurement update looks like this.

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,669
And once again, instead of passing around bel and bel bar,

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,004
we just use the mean and co-variance estimates from the predictions step.

7
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:26,189
What happens is, we use this h prime function to get some h of t matrix.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,560
In the general non-linear case,

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,429
this will require taking the Jacobian of the measurement model.

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,144
But for now this will just wind up being the C matrix from our linear measurement model.

11
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:44,730
Then I use this H matrix in the next line to compute what's called the Kalman game.

12
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,453
The Kalman game is going to be used in the next step to dictate

13
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:54,570
how much we should trust our new measurement compared to our previous belief.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,780
And calculating this Kalman game as a bunch of math,

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,579
but what it does is it takes

16
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,750
the old co-variance and transforms it using the measurement model,

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,775
and then adds the measurement noise,

18
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,630
R. Then I transform all of this math which

19
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,304
took place in the measurement space back into the state space,

20
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,610
and that gives me this Kalman game.

21
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,739
All of this math is what you get when you derive

22
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,534
the Bayes filter update step and you assume that everything is Gaussian.

23
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,719
It's a long derivation that we won't show here,

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,849
but the thing to take away is that this is

25
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,434
the mathematically correct way to get this Kalman game.

26
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:38,984
Now the next line is where we get our new mean MU or a new status estimate.

27
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:41,775
The new mean is just the old mean,

28
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,350
plus this Kalman game,

29
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,829
multiplied by the difference between the actual measurement,

30
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,504
and the measurement I would have expected based on my measurement model.

31
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:54,569
So, you can see this moves my estimate in the direction

32
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,264
of the new measurement by an amount that's dictated by the Kalman game.

33
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:01,484
Then finally, I compute

34
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:05,810
a new co-variance using some math that takes into account the Kalman game.

35
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,689
Then I return those update values and

36
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:15,034
those are my best possible estimate of the state after making a measurement.

37
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,079
So, hopefully from those equations and the measurement model,

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,610
you can implement the update stuff for the one D drone we've been discussing.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,090
Once you've implemented predict and update,

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,090
you've basically implemented a Kalman filter.

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,020
In practice, these predicted update functions might be

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,040
callbacks that get called whenever you set a new control input,

43
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,799
or receive a new measurement from a sensor.
