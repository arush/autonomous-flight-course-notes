1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,485
The Kalman Filter is the optimal algorithm for estimating the state of the one day drone.

2
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:10,650
And that's because in that case everything was linear and everything was Gaussian.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,730
But well, we can often justify the Gaussian assumption.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,004
The most interesting estimation problems are usually non-linear,

5
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,365
and the Kalman filter just won't work in those cases.

6
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:24,419
We need a different algorithm.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,480
The first algorithm we're going to use to solve

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,515
non-linear estimation problems is the extended Kalman Filter,

9
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,700
and it turns out that the math can get pretty tricky with EKFs.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,670
So, to try to avoid getting lost in the math,

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,734
we're going to be working with a very simple non-linear system,

12
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:46,994
and the system will be working with is pretty contrived but that's all right.

13
00:00:46,994 --> 00:00:49,214
The drone we'll be working with will be

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,370
a two-dimensional drone similar to what you've seen in the controls course,

15
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,179
except this drone will be constrained in the vertical direction,

16
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,000
so it won't be allowed to go up or down.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,760
That means the state of this drone is going to be given by its current role angle phi,

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,510
it's horizontal position Y and also Y dot.

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,715
And we're going to define a weird control input as well,

20
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:15,469
know how to simplify the math.

21
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:18,105
Instead of thinking of forces and moments,

22
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:22,230
we're just going to have one control input which lets us set phi directly.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,909
So, we command some roll angle and the drone just teleports to that phi.

24
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,619
The thrust we assume is constant and equal to one as is the mass.

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,715
So, if we want to accelerate this vehicle to the right,

26
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:38,430
we set some roll angle that's tilted correctly,

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,620
and some portion of that thrust equal to

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,875
the sine of phi will cause the vehicle to accelerate.

29
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,099
So, just like we did with the Kalman Filter,

30
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,125
the first thing we need to do is define a transition function for this model.

31
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:57,855
This is a function that takes as input x of t, u sub of t,

32
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:01,590
and delta t, and it returns x of t plus 1,

33
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,579
and the transition function for this system looks like this.

34
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,304
The new phi is easy.

35
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:09,224
It's just whatever we set it to be,

36
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:12,329
and I'm going to call that u sub of t comma phi,

37
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,719
which means the phi component of the control input.

38
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,330
That might be a bit of overkill since that's the only component of the control input.

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,995
But it will make the math easier later if we stay consistent now.

40
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:29,700
Next, we update the velocity y dot,

41
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,849
and that just means we take the current y dot and we have to

42
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,094
subtract the sin of phi times delta t. And know

43
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,669
I'm not writing phi but x sub t comma phi

44
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:45,034
to emphasize that phi is part of the state vector x.

45
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,520
Then to update y, well,

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,070
that's just the current y plus y dot times delta t. Now,

47
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,530
x sub t is a three vector,

48
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,280
and g takes an x sub t and a u sub t and it also returns a three vector,

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,985
the new x sub t after you apply the control input.

50
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,585
Now, this is unlike the one D case.

51
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:10,995
In the one D case,

52
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:13,425
we could write g as a linear equation.

53
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:18,900
We could write it as an a sub t which was constant times x sub t plus b

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,270
sub t which was also constant times u sub t. But here we can't do that,

55
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,730
and the reason is because of this sine.

56
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:32,729
We can't factor this into a and b matrices that don't depend on the state.

57
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,534
And that means that we won't be able to use

58
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:39,000
a Kalman Filter as our estimation algorithm for this system.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,908
If we want to use a Kalman Filter here,

60
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:45,525
we're going to have to work with a linear approximation of the system

61
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:50,640
that's linearized around whenever the current state of the vehicle is.
