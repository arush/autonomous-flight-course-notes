1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
So, the idea behind the Bayes' Filter

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,710
is that we'll know where the drone is from two different sources.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,339
First, we know what commands we send to the drone,

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:14,929
and we'll use that knowledge to predict the new state.

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,589
And of course, when we do that,

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,929
there's going to be some error in our prediction,

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,405
but we can still do something with that information.

8
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:24,734
And second, we still get to use the sensor measurements,

9
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,269
and of course, there's error in our sensor values.

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,490
But the fancy math trick will let us put these two pieces of information together in

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,440
the right way to get the robustness benefits of

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,854
averaging but also the responsiveness of fast updating.

13
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:44,774
The Bayes' Filter is a very general idea with many implementations.

14
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:46,409
So in this lesson,

15
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,994
we're going to discuss the Bayes' Filter first at a high level,

16
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:54,209
and then we're going to talk about one implementation called the Kalman Filter,

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,439
which is what happens when we represent everything as Gaussians.

18
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,214
And what happens is matrices.

19
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:06,060
Then, we'll dive into the extended Kalman Filter or EKF which is what

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,545
happens when everything is Gaussian but the state or observation models are non-linear.

21
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:16,484
And then, we can linearize around the state to make things Gaussian again,

22
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:19,349
and basically, use linearization to make things

23
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,799
Gaussian and then everything works out just like a Kalman Filter.

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,569
In the next lesson,

25
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,739
we'll also discuss the Unscented Kalman Filter or UKF.

26
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,599
And this is an even fancier math trick which is actually simpler to implement.

27
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,239
And with a UKF we estimate a non-linear state using special particles which we

28
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,909
can pass through a non-linear system instead

29
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,075
of linearizing the system like we do with the EKF.

30
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,980
In a later lesson,

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,590
Nick is actually going to cover another version of

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,359
the Bayes' Filter called the Particle Filter,

33
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,304
where we use particles or samples to

34
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:59,240
estimate a non-linear distribution which is not Gaussian.
