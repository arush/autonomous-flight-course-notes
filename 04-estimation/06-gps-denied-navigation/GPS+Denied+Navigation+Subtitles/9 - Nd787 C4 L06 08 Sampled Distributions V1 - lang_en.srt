1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
The first thing we need to do is figure out how to

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:05,099
represent a distribution with samples instead of parameters.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,865
A Gaussian can be neatly described with a mean and a covariance.

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:13,574
But now we're going to represent the distribution as a set of discrete samples x_i.

5
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:18,278
The estimators job is to create a set of samples that capture the distribution.

6
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:20,949
What's interesting about using samples,

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:23,199
is that you can often use the samples

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,774
directly in place of the parametric form of the distribution.

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,949
For example, let's say I need to give the control system

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,089
the mean of the distribution and I have a set of samples like this x_i,

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,090
if those samples are drawn from the distribution,

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,090
than they are naturally going to be denser around the mean,

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,595
and sparser further away from the mean.

14
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,280
Once I have the set of samples,

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
then I can compute the mean simply using x hat is equal to the sum of the samples.

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,184
Perhaps with some weights and we'll see where those weights come from shortly.

17
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:58,995
But the important thing is that I can use the samples to compute the mean exactly,

18
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,964
and I can do the same thing for the variance.

19
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:06,375
Okay, we can use samples and set of parameters to represent our distribution.

20
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,560
But where do these samples come from?

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,905
How do we sample from a known distribution?

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,969
One way is the computer.

23
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,480
Python gives us ways to sample from some kinds of known distributions.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,435
Num pi in particular is a variety of distributions that we can sample from.

25
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,010
When you look at the num pi documentation,

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:29,000
you see binomial, normal the poisson distribution et cetera.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,670
We can simple directly from these,

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,510
but often our distributions are a mixture of components or other kinds of

29
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,850
distributions that we might be able to evaluate that is for a given event or outcome,

30
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,919
we can evaluate the density of that point,

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,710
but we can't necessarily sample directly from that distribution.

32
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,054
So, what do we do in that situation?

33
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:52,610
In particular, how do we propagate our samples using

34
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,599
our knowledge of the commanded controls and the vehicle dynamics?
