1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,218
We've handled the motion propagation.

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:06,839
But if we want to do the same thing to incorporate the sensor model,

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,339
it gets more complicated.

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,949
The distribution we want to sample from,

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,199
given a sensor measurement is p of x sub t given

6
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,725
z sub t. It's not at all obvious how to sample from this distribution directly.

7
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:23,160
What is interesting however is that we can often evaluate distributions.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,250
That is; given a specific measurement z sub t,

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,585
we can evaluate the likelihood of a given state

10
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:32,020
x sub t. Given the ability to evaluate a distribution,

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,400
can we sample from it?

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,054
The answer is yes, we can do that using a process known as important sampling.

13
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:43,890
Let's assume that we have some distribution p of x that we want to sample from,

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,410
we don't know how but we have a way to evaluate it.

15
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,089
That is, given some value x we can at least compute p of x.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,120
We'll call this distribution, the target distribution.

17
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,140
Let's assume that we have some other distribution q of x that we can sample from.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,480
We'll call this the proposal distribution,

19
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,889
it can be anything at all.

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,640
Let's draw some samples,

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,689
xi from q of x.

22
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,364
Each of these vertical lines is a sample.

23
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:13,724
Now, let's imagine that we want to sample from this bimodal Gaussian distribution here.

24
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:16,104
So, that's our p of x, our target.

25
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:18,765
Mathematically p of x looks like this

26
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:22,299
with some weights to make sure everything is properly normalized.

27
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,204
Unfortunately, we can't always sample directly from multi-modal Gaussians,

28
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:29,969
but what we can do is we can sample from

29
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,150
a proposal distribution which in this case might be the uniform distribution.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,305
Given the ability to sample from this uniform distribution,

31
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:44,450
how do we turn these samples into samples that actually match the bimodal Gaussian?

32
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,394
Let's give each sample a weight

33
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:50,379
which we can represent by the height of the vertical line.

34
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:53,530
That weight is going to be equal to the ratio between

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,935
the target p of x of i and the proposal q of x of i.

36
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,250
We can now treat the weighted samples as if

37
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,519
they were drawn from the target distribution itself.

38
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,369
For instance, we can compute the mean of the target,

39
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,730
x^ as the sum of the weighted samples and that will give us the correct mean.

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,959
Furthermore, if we draw a fresh set of samples

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,379
x_star of y from the samples according to the weights,

42
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,009
samples with higher weight are more likely than lower weight samples,

43
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,599
which means that the new samples will be

44
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,439
distributed as if they were drawn from the target itself.

45
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,365
This is exactly what we wanted,

46
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:32,510
samples distributed according to some arbitrary distribution p of x.

47
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,754
To recap what we just did,

48
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,689
we started with some target distribution

49
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,419
p of x that we wanted to sample from but couldn't.

50
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:45,894
Then, we generated a uniform proposal distribution q of x from which we could sample.

51
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:49,360
Then, we sample from that proposal distribution and assign weights to

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,955
each sample according to the ratio of p of x over q of x.

53
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:57,719
Finally, we resample those particles according to the weights,

54
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,764
which left us with equally weighted particles distributed according to p of x.

55
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:07,339
This approach will work generally for any proposal and any target.

56
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,340
But let's plug in the values for the specific estimator that we want.

57
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,930
We started with samples drawn from our prior p of x sub t,

58
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,170
and we want to generate samples drawn from p of x sub t,

59
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,609
given z sub t. That means that our target is p of x sub t

60
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,585
given z sub t and our proposal is p of x sub t. Notice,

61
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:32,900
that if we use Bayes' rule we can rewrite our target as some normalizer

62
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,560
alpha times p of z sub t given x sub t times p of x sub t. Then,

63
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,280
the p of x sub t terms cancel and all of a sudden our weights become p of

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,650
z sub t given x sub t. We can safely ignore the normalizer alpha,

65
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,020
because we're going to resample from the weighted samples

66
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,075
anyhow and the normalizer will have no effect on that process.

67
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:56,500
This results should make sense intuitively.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,270
The weights now are just proportional to the likelihood of the samples.
