1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,229
One thing to note is that any sensor on a flying car

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:06,839
or any autonomous vehicle is going to be a digital device,

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,785
and can only return a discrete set of range values.

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:13,769
We could therefore collect a big dataset of laser range measurements

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,320
and simply count how many times we get each possible range value.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,594
Since the probability depends on the range to the actual object being sensed,

7
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:24,899
we would need to put the sensor at

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,219
all possible distances to obstacles and then collect our data.

9
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,789
But we could do that and we could count up

10
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,140
how many times we get each range value for each distance.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,480
This would give us a nice lookup table which would let us

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,194
convert an expected distance x sub t minus Lambda,

13
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:46,125
into a measurement probability distribution.

14
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:50,909
Now, how do we find Lambda the position of the nearest obstacle along

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,974
the bearing in order to compute the expected distance x sub t minus Lambda?

16
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:59,280
We've actually done this before in a grid map.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,755
Remember the Bresenham ray tracing algorithm from planning?

18
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,310
We can use that exact same algorithm again here.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,900
What we do is we put the vehicle on the map wherever a sample is,

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,260
and along the bearing that the sensor is measuring,

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,564
we basically walk through the grid cells until we actually get to an obstacle cell.

22
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:24,579
Of course, we are tracing between two points but from the sensor in a given direction.

23
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,450
We can get the Bresenham effect of a second point by

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,060
finding a point P2 at the edge of the map,

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,810
along the bearing of the sensor and then ray tracing from x sub t to

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,990
P2 and stopping when we hit our first obstacle cell in the map.

27
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:40,530
If we're working with a planar lidar that

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,605
spins and makes range measurements once every degree,

29
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:48,125
then that means that z sub t will be a 360 dimensional vector.

30
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,659
We can probably assume independent measurements,

31
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,789
which means that P of z sub t given x sub t is

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,109
just the product of the 360 individual measurements.

33
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:02,234
That means the weight of each sample will be the product of all these likelihoods.

34
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:05,668
Since we're doing this for every measurement,

35
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,859
for every sample x sub t,

36
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,724
i the computation can really add up.

37
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:15,530
That's why we like efficient ray tracing algorithms like the Bresenham algorithm.
