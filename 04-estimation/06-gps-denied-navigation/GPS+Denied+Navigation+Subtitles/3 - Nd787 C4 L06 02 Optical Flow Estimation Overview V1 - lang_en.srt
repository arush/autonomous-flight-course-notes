1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,410
Let's dive into Optical Flow.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,140
The goal here is to use a downward facing camera to

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,974
obtain an estimate of the vehicles x and y velocity.

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,240
We're going to do this by looking at what's called the

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,789
optical flow of the scene from frame to frame.

6
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,404
At the highest level,

7
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:17,879
this velocity estimation happens in two steps.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,015
First, optical flow analysis.

9
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:23,980
We need to analyze the data for my camera to obtain

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,050
the optical flow vector which describes the x and y velocity of pixels in the scene.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,009
Note that these velocities are measured in something like pixels per frame.

12
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,219
The second step is converting the velocity in pixels per

13
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,984
frame to a vehicle velocity measured in meters per second.

14
00:00:39,984 --> 00:00:42,994
As you can imagine, this step involves a lot of geometry.

15
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:45,030
The vehicles altitude above the ground,

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,495
it's role and it's pitch,

17
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:50,534
and it's body rates all affect the pixel velocities that the camera sees.

18
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:53,449
But once you've done this geometry correctly,

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,280
you'll be left with a good estimate of the vehicles x and y velocity.
