1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Okay. We have this equation which relates the optical flow vector,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,565
u and v, to the change in the image from t to t plus one.

3
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,650
But there's a problem here, because this is a single equation with two unknowns.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,070
We don't know u or v,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,769
and this isn't just an abstract mathematical problem,

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:19,570
it's an operational problem called the aperture problem.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,160
The fact that we have one equation with two unknowns means that there

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,859
could be motion in the image that we can't necessarily explain.

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,725
For example, if I have a pixel on a line,

10
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,030
and the camera moves,

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,929
I can't disambiguate any motion parallel to

12
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,759
the image gradient that is parallel to that one.

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,905
How do we solve this ill-posed problem?

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:45,270
Remember, up until now we've been looking at individual pixels.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,625
There are a few things we might be tempted to do.

16
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,994
For example, we might want to make u and v consistent everywhere in the image.

17
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:56,429
But that doesn't actually work because the projective geometry of camera imaging

18
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,945
causes pixel motion to have

19
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:02,070
variable velocity depending on where in the frame of pixel is.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,680
Instead, what we do is try to make the motion of some group of local pixels consistent.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,290
This is known as a Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,930
Let's assume that the pixel neighbors have the same u,v velocity vector.

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,110
If we use a five-by-five window,

24
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:20,429
that gives us 25 equations per pixel,

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,610
and you see the 25 equations here.

26
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,769
This equation should look very familiar.

27
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:28,399
This is essentially a least squares problem that we're trying to solve for u and

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,270
v. This can be solved in closed form by noticing that it's in the form,

29
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:35,079
minus b plus a times x equals zero.

30
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,504
As you learned in the first estimation lesson,

31
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:40,979
this can be solved as a least squares estimator where x is given by

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,630
A transpose A to the power minus one times A transpose again times b.

33
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:51,719
The x this gives us will be the best estimate for u and v. It's important to notice that

34
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,629
the particular matrix elements in A transpose A tells us

35
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,039
a lot about where we will get a good velocity estimates.

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,075
The eigenvalues of A transpose A are essentially the local image gradient.

37
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,484
When the eigenvalues are small,

38
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:08,675
we will not have much image gradient in any direction,

39
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,070
and the least square solution will be affected

40
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,769
by small variations of the image intensities.

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,860
If we look at a five-by-five patch here in this particular image,

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,180
the spatial gradient is very low,

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,835
and we will not get much optical flow there.

44
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:25,570
When the ratio of eigenvalues are large,

45
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,764
we'll have a strong image gradient in one direction, but not another.

46
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:33,479
Imagine that we have a strong spatial gradient in the x direction,

47
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,819
but a very low spatial gradient in the y direction which typically happens along an edge.

48
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,039
The least squares solution will be affected by

49
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,824
small variations in the image intensity along the edge.

50
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:49,789
When the eigenvalues are large and the ratio of the eigenvalues are small,

51
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,489
we have a strong image gradient in both directions

52
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,370
which usually happens for highly textured regions,

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,409
and we'll be able to accurately recover the relative motion of these pixels.

54
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,270
Though Shi-Tomasi features we were looking at

55
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,390
a few minutes ago are designed exactly for this idea.

56
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,625
Finding features where the smallest eigenvalue is still large.

57
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,625
You can also try other features for optical flow such as

58
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,460
the Harris corner detector which is specifically designed to

59
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,034
keep the ratio of the eigenvalues small as well.

60
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:23,599
But given the ability to extract features from an image,

61
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,219
you can now solve the least squares problem and

62
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,344
determine the motion of those features in subsequent images.

63
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,800
That's exactly what you're going to do using

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,880
a Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm in your next exercise.
