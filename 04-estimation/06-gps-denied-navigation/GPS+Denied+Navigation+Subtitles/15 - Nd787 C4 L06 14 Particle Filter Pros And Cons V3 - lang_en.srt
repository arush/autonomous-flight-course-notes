00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
What are the pros and cons of a particle filter?

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:08,130
Well, the pros are that we can obviously express many more distributions than before.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,070
We can also capture more complex distributions of

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,349
our state estimate such as multi-modal distributions.

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:19,699
Unlike the Kalman filter where our initial estimate is always a Gaussian,

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,359
given by a mean and a co-variance,

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,265
our initial estimate can be given by any initial distribution that we can evaluate,

8
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:29,129
in order to sample from it.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,450
For example, we've already discussed using the uniform distribution to allow us to

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,130
represent the idea that the vehicle is somewhere in the general environment,

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,855
but we're not really sure where.

12
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:42,015
This doesn't happen very often,

13
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:46,554
but it is a nice thing to know about as an error recovery mechanism if for instance,

14
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:49,409
estimation fails in some dramatic way.

15
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,869
What are the cons? Well, multi-modal distributions can cause problems for

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,449
the control system in that we have to decide

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,730
what state to give the controller as our best estimate.

18
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,319
Naively taking the mean of a multi-modal distribution

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,704
and using it as a state estimate is obviously the wrong thing to do.

20
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:13,284
As an example, imagine you had some bi-modal distribution,

21
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:16,979
then the mean is somewhere in the middle and that's actually

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,150
a very unlikely state and the controller could have failures.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,815
Another problem with particle filters is that they tend to be computationally costly.

24
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:30,390
There's no way to know ahead of time how many particles you need which

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,299
is operationally a problem but even worse is that empirically,

26
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,349
the number of particles needed to get a good state estimate seems

27
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,744
to grow exponentially with the number of variables in the state vector.

28
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:47,689
For a state estimate with 12,16, or 20 variables,

29
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,420
which is often the case for things like flying cars,

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,909
particle filtering can be prohibitive.

31
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,340
One way to address this problem is to use

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,515
a particle filter over a subset of the state variables.

33
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:01,659
For example, just over the position of the vehicle,

34
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,509
and then you can incorporate the particle filters position estimate as

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,955
an effective measurement inside a Kalman Filter which runs over the entire state vector.

36
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:14,980
That particular approach is what was used for

37
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,780
state estimation in this airplane flying in a parking garage at MIT.

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,259
The sensor is a laser range finder and we wanted to use

39
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:28,479
a particle filter to handle the badly non-linear laser range finder measurements,

40
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,044
but we didn't want to pay the computational cost of running a full particle filter.

41
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:36,639
So, the particle filter ran over the position variables,

42
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,699
and the Kalman filter incorporated the output as a measurement,

43
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,185
along with the IMU,

44
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:46,530
to get a consistent and accurate state estimate in flight.
