00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,214
Evaluating p of Z sub t,

2
00:00:02,214 --> 00:00:05,504
given X sub t, will of course depend on your specific sensor.

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:09,025
Let's take a look at using a range sensor in a 2D map.

4
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:11,790
A range sensor emits a pulse of energy along

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,024
some bearing and that energy is reflected off the closest obstacle.

6
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,559
And, based on the return properties of that energy,

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,689
either the time of flight or the phase,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,130
we get a measurement of distance.

9
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,119
Errors in the measured range are typically normally

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,720
distributed around the true range and that distribution can be

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,659
parameterized with a mean given by the true range of

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,949
the obstacle and some variance that depends on the sensors which can be measured.

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,780
But, there's also some probability of getting N inappropriately short range,

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,310
and some probability of never getting any reflected energy at all.

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,120
Which we'd interpret as a measurement of some maximum range.

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,049
All of these probabilities of these specific events depend

17
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,969
on the sensor and can be measured from real data.

18
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:03,759
What we need is the probability of a particular measured range,

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,625
given the vehicle is in some position.

20
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:10,254
But we don't really believe that the behavior of the sensor changes with the position.

21
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:14,804
What actually changes with the position is the distance to the obstacle.

22
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:18,030
The probability of a given range at a given position

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,534
is actually a function of the obstacles on the map.

24
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:24,405
This means we can write the sensor model,

25
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:27,310
p of Z sub t given X of t and m,

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,590
where m is a map.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,600
If the sensor distribution really depends on

28
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,030
the realest position of the vehicle in the map,

29
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,674
we can say that the probability of the measurements Z sub t given X sub t and m,

30
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:40,500
is actually equal to the probability of the measurement,

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,590
given some function of the state and the map.

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,255
That function is just the Euclidean distance between the state and the nearest obstacle.

33
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:54,859
Here, lambda is the position of the nearest obstacle along the bearing of the sensor.

34
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,734
After all of this,

35
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:00,299
we have a sensor model that looks something like this.

36
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,295
As you'd expect, there's a peak here,

37
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:06,605
where the distance is equal to the actual Euclidean distance.

38
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:11,405
There's some variance around that peak which depends on the sensor and then there's

39
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:16,724
also some probability of measuring a maximum range or a short range.

40
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,370
And it's this curve here that characterizes

41
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,270
the probability distribution of all possible measurements given that,

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,450
this is where the obstacle actually is.

43
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,479
And it's this funny shape that's no longer Gaussian that's really

44
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,530
hard to capture inside Kalman filter type distributions.
