00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,184
Okay. We just looked at two different Monte-Carlo sampling techniques.

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:09,439
First for sampling a posterior or the vehicle dynamics given a control and the

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,910
second for sampling a posterior over

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,429
the state given sensor measurements and doing sensor fusion.

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,939
You can now put these together to get

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,359
an estimation algorithm known as the particle filter.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,625
The first step is just like in the Kalman filter.

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,399
We start with an initial estimate of where the vehicle might be.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,129
This might be a normal distribution with some mean, and some covariance.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,420
Then we sample that distribution to get a set of

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,810
samples or particles that will be densest around that mean,

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,815
and with fewer samples as we go further from the mean.

13
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:46,864
You can think of each of these particles as a vehicle that we're modeling.

14
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,090
The hope is that if we do this right,

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,495
then our cloud of particles will have a mean that's equal to our vehicles actual mean.

16
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:58,259
Once we have our prior distribution of samples/particles,

17
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,679
we can take some control action.

18
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,009
Let say U knot,

19
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,109
and use it along with some noise to

20
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,234
propagate those samples according to the vehicle dynamics,

21
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,765
and this leaves us with a new distribution of samples.

22
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:15,275
This is analogous to the prediction step of a Kalman filter.

23
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,410
Then when a measurement comes in,

24
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,420
we can compute the weight for each sample

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,850
as the likelihood of the measurement for each sample.

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,879
Basically, we're comparing the vehicles actual observation of

27
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,454
the world to what each of the particles would see if we we're making the observations.

28
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,765
When those are similar,

29
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:34,700
the likelihood for that particle is high.

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,375
Let's say that we sense a landmark nearby in the environment.

31
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,650
Well, the samples that have expected measurements of

32
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,615
that landmark that are closest to the actual measurement of the landmark

33
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:49,739
are going to have the highest weights and the samples that have expected measurements to

34
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,239
the landmark that are furthest from

35
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,530
the actual measurement to the landmark are going to have the lowest weights.

36
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,849
Then, when we resample from those weighted samples according to those weights,

37
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,839
will end up with many more samples around the location of the actual vehicle

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,700
and very few samples far from

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,740
location of the vehicle based on that measurement to the landmark.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,610
Unlike the Kalman filter where our initial estimate is

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,099
always a gaussian given by a mean and a covariance,

42
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,409
and a posterior is always a mean and a covariance,

43
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,625
our initial estimate here can be given by any initial distribution.

44
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,389
We can sample from the uniform distribution for example,

45
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,094
which allows us to localize the vehicle given prior information that's

46
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:30,870
very vague when it's not at all clear where the vehicle is.
