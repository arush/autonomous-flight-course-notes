1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, you've completed the exercise that allows you to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,080
get a velocity estimate in the image plane for the (u,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,254
v) velocity vector, but you have two new problems now.

4
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:13,860
The first problem is that you'll have a lot of (u, v) vectors,

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,719
one for each of the features that you asked

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,820
the Lucas-Kanade algorithm to give you the velocity for.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,765
Well, that's easy to deal with.

8
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:24,054
You could take the most likely vector or the mean velocity vector.

9
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:27,339
Remember, those aren't the same but either will do.

10
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:31,149
The second problem is that the velocities are in the image plane.

11
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:34,269
They're measured in something like pixels per frame,

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,570
and if you want to incorporate that into your estimate for your vehicle,

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,090
you need a way to actually put the velocity vector in

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,605
the image plane into the body coordinates of the vehicle.

15
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:46,419
Basically, the optical flow vectors tell us

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,940
something about the apparent motion of the scene,

17
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,724
but we really want to recover the velocity vector of the camera itself.

18
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:55,609
This is basically going to be a geometry problem.

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,659
The full derivation of recovering the geometry from a set

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,599
of optical flow vectors is somewhat involved,

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
but let's take a look at the intuition for a vehicle with a downward facing camera.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,079
We have a camera looking at a pixel on the ground plane.

23
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:14,194
The pixel intensity is generated by the appearance of some point in the ECEF frame,

24
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:16,259
given by P superscript e,

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,495
which is a three vector,

26
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:22,469
Px Py Pz, and we're going to assume that this point is on the ground plane.

27
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,500
The same location in the body frame is given by P superscript b and projective geometry

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,724
puts the pixel into the image frame P superscript i by dividing by the Z-coordinate.

29
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:35,689
We assume that we have a rotation matrix R between

30
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,884
the world and the body frame and a translation matrix,

31
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,910
or really a translation vector,

32
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,909
and we assume that we know the rotation matrix from the IMU gyros,

33
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,390
and while we don't know the translation vector from

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,450
the earth ECEF frame to the body frame,

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,939
we assume we know the height above the ground plane from

36
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,355
some depth sensor such as a sonar,

37
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:57,665
point LIDAR or a barometer.

38
00:01:57,665 --> 00:02:03,240
What we want is the body frame velocity V superscript b in the XY plane.

39
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,979
And, we're going to assume that V superscript b is

40
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,390
a function of the rotation matrix and the derivative of the translation vector.

41
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,044
The relative motion of each pixel can be explained

42
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,844
basically as a combination of two terms.

43
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:20,305
The first term contains V superscript b explicitly.

44
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:22,550
This is basically how much the pixel is moving

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,430
in the image frame based on camera translation.

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,040
The second term explains the pixel motion as a function of the camera rotation.

47
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,740
Before we can solve the equation for V superscript b,

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,540
we have to deal with the fact that the first term

49
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,939
depends on the actual height of the camera,

50
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,099
that is, the distance from the point P superscript e to the camera plane.

51
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,574
But given that measurement,

52
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:50,464
we can solve for PZ according to this equation,

53
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,085
where d is the measured depth from our sensor,

54
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,099
theta is the role and phi is the pitch.

55
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,169
It's fundamentally this relationship between the height and the apparent motion of

56
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,719
the pixels in the frame that allows us to

57
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,300
translate the optical flow vectors into the body frame.

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,540
Now that we have all the necessary terms,

59
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,359
we can solve for V superscript b in this equation as a least squares problem.
