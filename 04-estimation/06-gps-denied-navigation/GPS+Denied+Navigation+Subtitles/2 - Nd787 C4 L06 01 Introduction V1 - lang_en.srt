1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
In this final lesson,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,719
we're going to look at a couple of different challenges in estimation.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,625
The first challenge is, how can we incorporate camera images into our estimator?

4
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,884
We could easily spend multiple lessons on how to use

5
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:16,079
images to estimate our position and velocity,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,119
how to estimate the position of obstacles around

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,660
us and how to track other things moving around us.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,454
We're not going to have time to look at all of those questions.

9
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,019
But a lot of vehicles,

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,089
including ones you might already own like the Crazyflie use a very simple approach with

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,949
a downward facing camera to estimate

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,575
the velocity vector using a technique called optical flow.

13
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:38,730
We'll show you how you can use optical flow to get

14
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:42,839
a reasonable state estimate for your vehicle even when you don't have GPS.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,930
It's not perfect, but it's a useful thing to know about and

16
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,920
something you could try for indoor flight on your own quadrotor.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,410
The second thing we're going to look at,

18
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,189
is an alternative technique to Kalman Filter called The Particle Filter.

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,945
The Particle Filter does a much better job of handling range sensors,

20
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,765
being used to estimate the position of the vehicle in a map.

21
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,420
Remember that the Kalman filter has

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,719
strong assumptions of Gaussian noise and linear models.

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,579
The EKF and UK let us relax the linearity assumption somewhat,

24
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,799
but The Particle Filter lets us handle non-linear and non-gaussian systems even better.

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,424
Notice that both of these topics are designed to give you an estimate without

26
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:29,844
GPS and GPS to night navigation is really important for flying cars.

27
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:33,769
When your vehicle is operating in an urban environment close to the ground,

28
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,920
our vehicle is in a regime where GPS is very unreliable.

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,680
Being able to use additional sensors to compensate for

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,250
GPS errors or manage temporary GPS outages,

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,730
is crucial to the reliable operation of your vehicle.
