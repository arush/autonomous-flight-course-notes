1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
So, now we are ready to write the code that you

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,879
would actually put in a drone to fly a real physical drone.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,789
We're going to start a bit with

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,375
the proto-typing setup where we're going to do code in Python,

5
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:14,640
and we have a simulation of a join that you can then control.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,359
You should start not just writing the code but also kind

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,515
of tuning the various gains of the controller because it's actually do matter a lot.

8
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:27,565
Then, we're going to import this code from Python to C plus plus

9
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:33,000
which is the preferred systems language because it's much more predictable in execution.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,814
In C plus plus, you can do a few exercises.

11
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:37,609
We're going to tighten the dynamics of

12
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,799
your drone a little bit to make it even harder to control.

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,000
So, you get a flavor for how hard it actually is to make a drone fly.
