1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,145
In the previous lesson,

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:05,054
the vehicle could only move up and down.

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:06,765
Another way of saying this,

4
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:10,349
is that the vehicle only had one degree of freedom.

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,835
Likewise, the vehicle could be controlled through one control variable,

6
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:17,609
the total thrust. And this worked fine.

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,829
One controllable variable, thrust,

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,014
could control one degree of freedom, the z position.

9
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:29,670
But a quadrotor moving in the two-dimensional vertical plane is fundamentally different,

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,810
as is a quadrotor moving in three-dimensions,

11
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:34,719
but we'll get to that in the next lesson.

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,780
This two-dimensional system has two properties that

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,314
the one-dimensional system did not, under-actuation and coupling.

14
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:46,342
Let's start with under-actuation.

15
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,865
Notice, that now we have three degrees of freedom,

16
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:50,800
Y, Z, and phi.

17
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,244
But we only have two variables that we can set directly, U1 and U2.

18
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,169
If you try to use these two variables to

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,395
control all three degrees of freedom simultaneously,

20
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,881
you will find that it just cannot be done.

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,908
Such a system is under-actuated.

22
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:13,790
Luckily, for us, it's still possible to control two of the degrees of freedom,

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,885
as long as we sacrifice control of the third degree of freedom.

24
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,630
So, for our purposes in this lesson,

25
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:26,479
we will be able to define a trajectory with particular values of Y and Z for instance,

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,350
and you'll be able to write a controller that can actually follow that trajectory.
