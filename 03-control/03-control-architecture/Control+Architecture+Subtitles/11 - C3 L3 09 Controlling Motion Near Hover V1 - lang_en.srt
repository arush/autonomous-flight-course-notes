1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Now that we have our linearized equations that should work well around the hover state,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,289
we need to actually use these equations to control the state of the vehicle.

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,644
And looking at these equations,

4
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:17,750
it's easiest to think about how you would control the z position of the drone.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,070
In fact, we have seen this very equation in the last lesson.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,190
There, we have defined U1 bar to

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,740
remind us just how directly we can control a z acceleration.

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,584
By properly setting U1,

9
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:35,620
you can directly set the vertical acceleration of the drone.

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,074
And as time passes,

11
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:44,065
this influences the vertical velocity which over time influences the vertical position.

12
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:45,784
And in the last lesson,

13
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:50,794
you learned how to use a PID controller to control exactly this system.

14
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:53,899
And in fact, we will use a very similar controller in

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,469
this lesson to control the altitude of our 2D drone.

16
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,689
But how do we control the y position?

17
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,769
This is still a second order system and we are

18
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,079
still going to control y through its second derivative.

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,030
So we will still have something like this.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,430
And when we look at equation 1,

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,610
we can see that we need to change phi to set y double dot.

22
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,894
But we don't have direct control over phi.

23
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:27,140
We only have control over its second derivative.

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,864
So this thing we have control over is U2.

25
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:33,214
We want to control y.

26
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:38,540
So what we need to do is to use U2 to set phi double dot.

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:45,065
After two integrations, this will give us a phi which relates directly to y double dot.

28
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,819
Then, after two more integrations,

29
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,299
this gives us y position.

30
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,745
In short, we can control y but we have to do it through phi.

31
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:58,550
And when we think about the system this way,

32
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:04,519
we can see that U2 bar is equal to the fourth derivative of the y position.

33
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,377
So we can enforce a step change in y for a triple dot,

34
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:13,120
but we cannot enforce a step change in any lower derivative.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,240
Take a second to think about this.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,000
What are the implications for control?
