1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,254
These equations are really useful equations.

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:08,774
They tell us what will happen for any angle and any thrust and any torque.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,600
So, these equations are good because one,

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,890
they for the most part capture the true physics of the system.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,795
And because of that, they can make

6
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:23,490
pretty accurate predictions about how the systems will change in time.

7
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:29,750
And two, these equations work at any angle for any controls.

8
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,030
They don't break down when numbers get too big or too small.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,760
And in general, this is why you use non-linear equations when you choose to use them.

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,448
But these are not linear differential equations,

11
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:46,089
the equations would be linear if

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,470
the right hand side of each of the equations would be in a form like this,

13
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,750
where the cs are constants.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,200
So, no sine, cosine or multiplication of input and state like u times phi.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,510
If you try to plot them as a function of u1 of phi or any of the variables,

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,920
you would get straight lines.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,200
And control theorists love when equations are linear.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,290
We have a large tool set of linear control techniques

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,635
for which we can prove stability in a straightforward way.

20
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:20,460
We love linear equations so much that sometimes we'll bend over

21
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,123
backwards to find linear approximations for non-linear equations like this.

22
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,000
And in the next few segments,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,310
I want to show you some intuition for how we linearize these sorts of equations.
