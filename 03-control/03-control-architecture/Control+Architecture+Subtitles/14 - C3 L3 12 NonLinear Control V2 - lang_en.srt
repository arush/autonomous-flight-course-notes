1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,089
The cascaded controller you have been working with

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,644
uses the Linearized Dynamics we discussed earlier.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,990
And now it's time to convert that controller to

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,445
a non-linear controller based on the non-linear dynamics we started with.

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,519
And this isn't too much of a change,

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,500
we still aim to have three double integrator equations that we control but to get

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,585
those this time we need some non-linear transformations,

8
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:32,443
as a result there are two big changes to the overall data flow.

9
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:36,510
Now we have to recap all the z and y motions by

10
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,655
passing the commanded thrust to the by position controller as well as to the drone.

11
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,660
And notice that we chose the command thrust based

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,309
only on the desires that motion and the current measured angle phi.

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,975
We don't consider the effect that thrust will have on the y motion.

14
00:00:54,975 --> 00:01:00,795
Even so that command thrust will wind up impacting both the z and y motion.

15
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,969
In the next activity,

16
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,784
you will turn the linear controller you've been working with into a non-linear one.

17
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:11,250
The actual mass that you'll implement is shown below.
