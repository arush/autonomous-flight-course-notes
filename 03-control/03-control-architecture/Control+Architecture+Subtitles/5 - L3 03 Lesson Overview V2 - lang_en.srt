1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,025
In this lesson, you will learn how to design and implement

2
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:09,964
a full cascaded control of an underactuated quad moving in two dimensions.

3
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:13,984
You've going to get there in three main steps.

4
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:16,277
First, we'll start by linearizing

5
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:21,245
the 2D dynamic equations that I've shown you a few times already.

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:25,250
Linearization is an incredibly useful mathematical tool

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,115
that's used throughout robotics to tame the math when it becomes hard to work with.

8
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,844
And in this case,

9
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:34,859
linearization will also lead to decoupling of

10
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,445
the dynamics of the system in the y and z directions,

11
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:44,185
which means we'll be able to think about each of these directions completely separately.

12
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:48,030
Next, we'll find that y control in the z direction can still use

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,649
a single PID controller like the one you have worked with in the last lesson.

14
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,993
The y direction won't be quite as easy.

15
00:00:55,993 --> 00:00:58,765
To control the vehicle in the y direction,

16
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:03,625
we will need to introduce what's called the cascaded control structure.

17
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:07,655
Once you're comfortable with a cascaded control architecture,

18
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:11,269
we will reintroduce the nonlinear equations of motion

19
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,515
and you will implement a full non-linear cascaded controller,

20
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:19,474
which controls a drone that can move in the y or z plane.

21
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:24,775
This is an important stepping stone to watch the full 3D control of a quadrotor.

22
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:27,530
Remember, the quadrotor is symmetric and the

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,000
forward-back motion will be very similar to the left-right motion.
