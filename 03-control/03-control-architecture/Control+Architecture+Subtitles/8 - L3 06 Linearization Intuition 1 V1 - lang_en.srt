1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,919
The first thing we did in the previous example,

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,740
was to choose the operating point that we wanted to linearize around.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,740
The first step in linearizing any non linear system is

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,910
to choose some state of the system to linearize around.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,195
Now, let's think about quadrotors again.

6
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:21,993
What state of the system does it make sense to linearize around?

7
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:24,855
What should we choose as an operating point?

8
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:30,902
Since our approximations are only valid in a small region around the operating point,

9
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:34,965
it's helpful to linearize around an equilibrium state.

10
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:41,763
An equilibrium exists when we can find certain fixed and non changing control inputs,

11
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:45,460
where the velocities and accelerations in the y,

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,215
z and phi dimensions are all zero.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,415
Intuitively, this is a state that the vehicle can

14
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:55,128
actually stay at for an extended period of time.

15
00:00:55,128 --> 00:01:02,149
For a quadrotor, the only state that is in equilibrium is usually called hover.

16
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,894
I'm going to ask some questions about hover.

17
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:08,464
You can answer any of these by thinking mathematically,

18
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:11,829
or intuitively about what it means to hover.

19
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:16,000
But try to use both approaches before you submit any of the answers.
