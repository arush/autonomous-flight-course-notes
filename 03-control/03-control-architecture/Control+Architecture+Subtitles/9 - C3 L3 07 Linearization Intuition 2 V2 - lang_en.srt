1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,005
When hovering, role must be zero.

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:07,134
If it variant then y double dot would be non-zero.

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,969
y and z can be anything,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,415
and this makes sense intuitively.

5
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:16,509
A quadrotor can hover here or it can hover over there.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,785
The values of its y and z coordinates don't matter.

7
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:26,125
It's thrust, u1 must be empty to support the weight.

8
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:31,149
And u2 must two zero to ensure zero rotational acceleration.

9
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:37,030
So we are linearizing around the state in the system where these statements are true.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,880
And I want to point out that while

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,540
these exact values must hold for the quadrotor to hover.

12
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,479
We want to linearize around hover.

13
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,974
When we linearize around an equilibrium point,

14
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:56,230
we aren't just solving the control problem for that one equilibrium configuration.

15
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,759
In this case hover,

16
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,549
but we find an approximation for other configurations that are nearby in the state space.

17
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:07,030
So, the next thing I want to do in this derivation is

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,810
figure out the consequences of phi being close to zero.

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:18,010
As you can see phi shows up in the sine in the y term and the cosine in the z term.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,865
And both of these contribute to the non-linearity of the system.

21
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,458
So it will be good to simplify this part.

22
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:30,790
So let's look at what happens to the one term sine of phi when phi is close to zero.

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,640
And to do this let's zoom in.

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,864
When we measure phi in radians and then zoom in very close to phi is equal to zero.

25
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:46,899
The graph of y equals to sine of phi looks almost identical to y is equal to phi.

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,990
Linearization finds the line that is the tangent to the operating point.

27
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:59,769
And here the line tangent to sine of phi at phi equal to zero is y equals phi.

28
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,709
So, if we are trying to approximate

29
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,369
sine of phi in the neighborhood of phi is equal to zero.

30
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,344
It seems like we should just replace sine of phi with phi.

31
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:13,884
Likewise, if we zoom in on the cosine function.

32
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,090
We can see that cosine of phi and

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,944
its tangent line are about equal to one when phi is small.

34
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:22,870
So we can replace cosine of phi with

35
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,659
one and that will change our z double dot equation.

36
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,444
This is a big step.

37
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:31,379
We've gotten rid of our sines and cosines.
