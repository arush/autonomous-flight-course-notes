00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,205
In the previous video,

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:05,016
I mentioned that if you want to control y and z,

3
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:07,592
you have to sacrifice control of phi.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,439
And one way of understanding why this

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,184
is the case is to look at how these equations are coupled.

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:16,475
So, looking at the y equation,

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,415
we see there's a sine phi term.

8
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:24,399
So, this means that y behavior is somehow tied to the roll angle phi.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,104
In the z equation,

10
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:28,405
you can see there's also a phi term,

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:34,460
a cosine phi, which means that z behavior is also tied to the roll angle.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,145
So, we can say that y and z motion are coupled through the roll angle phi.

13
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,940
Let's think through what would happen if we tried to

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:46,128
simultaneously control y, z, and phi.

15
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:49,559
First, let's control some phi behavior.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,355
Well, looking at the last equation of motion,

17
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:55,339
you can see that we can do this but

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,520
it will require spending one of our control variables,

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,500
in this case, u2.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,990
Next, we could specify y behavior.

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,170
But since we've already fixed phi,

22
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,140
we have to spend our other control variable to fix y,

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,355
in this case u1.

24
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:15,064
Now, if you try to specify z, we find that we can't.

25
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:18,799
We've already used up most of our control variables and we have

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,284
no more control knobs left to turn to influence the system.

27
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,254
So, you can see that the messiness of the system,

28
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,875
is in some ways,

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,950
due to the coupling inherent in the system.

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,719
If you want a picture to demonstrate this coupling,

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,560
you can think of a vehicle pitched at some angle phi.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,820
Any thrust that it commands will be shared in the y and z directions.

33
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:47,329
This coupling has important consequences for the controller architecture,

34
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,000
which you'll understand by the end of this lesson.
