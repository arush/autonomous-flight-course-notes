00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,365
The fundamental idea of linearization is to approximate

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,820
a non-linear equation locally by a linear equation.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,800
To explain this idea,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,929
let's leave the world of quadrotors and just talk about the mass for a second.

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,140
Take this quadratic function for example,

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,929
f of x = x squared.

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,664
And let's say we want to linearize this function around x = 1.

8
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:31,714
We call x = 1 the operating point.

9
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:37,712
We want to find a straight line that best approximates the graph at this point,

10
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,680
which means it has to pass through

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,119
this point and it has to have the same slope at this point.

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,239
We can find the slope of the parabola at

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,539
this point using calculus and pretty quickly find

14
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:57,469
that this is the tangent line to the graph of the parabola at the operating point.

15
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,219
Now, if you zoom in close to the operating point,

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,569
you can see that in this region,

17
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,979
the blue and the black line are really close to each other.

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,855
So the blue line is a really good linear approximation of y = x squared in this region.

19
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:20,484
Now, what's the equation of this blue line?

20
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:24,385
What linear equation gives a good approximation to

21
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,719
f of x equals x squared when x is close to 1?

22
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,700
Well, the equation for this line winds up being 2 x - 1.

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,359
But there's a more informative way we can write that.

24
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,980
Now, I wrote this equation in a very particular way.

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,870
Let me explain. First, look at this x - 1.

26
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,590
Another way to think of this term is as delta x.

27
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,250
It tells you how far x is from the operating point,

28
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,215
which in this case was 1.

29
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:59,260
Then there's this one over here.

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:06,535
That's just the value of the original function at the operating point of x = 1.

31
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:11,634
The original function was x squared and 1 squared is just 1.

32
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,769
Then there's this 2.

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,730
This 2 winds up being the slope of the original function at the operating point.

34
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:24,784
And you can get that by taking the derivative of the original function.

35
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:28,384
And so we are left with this very general result.

36
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:34,429
This says that the equation of the best linear approximation of a function around

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,909
an operating point is just the value of

38
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:43,515
that original function plus this other term which is just the slope,

39
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:48,979
f prime, times the deviation from the operating point delta x.
