00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:05,300
You've implemented some pretty serious control logic in

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,365
this lesson and learned quite a bit about control theory in the process.

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,720
First, you saw how the 2D plane of quadrotor is

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:19,514
an underactuated system because while it has three degrees of freedom, with its y, z,

6
00:00:19,514 --> 00:00:24,515
and phi coordinates, they only directly control two quantities,

7
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:27,205
the thrust and the rotational movement,

8
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,619
which we called U1 and U2.

9
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,615
Then you saw how we could directly control two of those three degrees of freedom,

10
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:41,345
namely y and z, if we sacrifice control of the third degree of freedom.

11
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:45,231
Then we started thinking about how we would control y and z,

12
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:51,327
and you saw that when we linearize the dynamics of the system around the hover state,

13
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:55,070
the equations that governed y and z became decoupled,

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,665
which meant we could control each independently.

15
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:03,230
U1 could be used to control the altitude and

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,945
U2 could be used to control the lateral motion in the y direction.

17
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,665
Then we noticed something interesting,

18
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:15,770
and that was how U2 controlled the motion in the y direction.

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,095
Instead of controlling y directly,

20
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:23,675
it did so by first controlling the intermediate variable of roll, or phi.

21
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:29,675
This realization led us to use a cascaded control structure where you first

22
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:35,640
implemented and tuned the inner faster control loop which controlled the roll angle,

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,625
and once that was working,

24
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:42,260
you implemented a slower outer control loop which took information about

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,555
the y trajectory and used it to set the target roll angle for the inner controller.

26
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,215
In the next lesson,

27
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:54,100
you'll be taking the complexity and realism up a level by

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,000
designing a controller for quadrotor of that operates in a three-dimensional world.
