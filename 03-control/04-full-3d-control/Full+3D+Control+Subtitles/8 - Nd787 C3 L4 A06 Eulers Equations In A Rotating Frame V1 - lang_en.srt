00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,234
In lesson one, you saw the following equation.

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:08,584
And this equation says that a moment will cause a rotational acceleration.

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:14,509
And in this equation, all of these variables are just plain scalar numbers.

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,894
In three dimensions, this equation changes.

5
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:24,550
Note that this omega here is a length three vector with the three rotation rates.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,560
And M is a length three vector giving moments about the x,

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,809
y, and z axis.

8
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,579
And the I term is a three by three inertia matrix summarizing all moments of inertia.

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,539
This is a nice equation but unfortunately,

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,030
it is only valid if we work in the world frame.

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,520
And it turns out that there are lots of

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,700
mathematical reasons why we don't want to work in the world frame for the step.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,185
Namely, we want to calculate accelerations in the body frame.

14
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:58,245
Remember, all of our moments are relative to the body frame,

15
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:02,419
and our gyros measure rotation rates about the body frames axis.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,579
And this moment of inertia is only a nice constant in diagonal matrix in the body frame.

17
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,149
So, to get a version of this equation where torques and

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,600
moments of inertia are expressed in the body frame,

19
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,879
we need to add some mathematical complexity.

20
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,949
And now, when we work in the body frame,

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,945
we have this additional term which you can read as omega cross I omega.

22
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:32,734
And this cross operation is a way of multiplying vectors called the cross product.

23
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:36,280
The details of the cross product, I explained below.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,379
But honestly, any matrix math library has a cross product function you can simply call.

25
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,359
Now, at this point,

26
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,739
you might be feeling a little overwhelmed by math.

27
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:53,544
And understand that everything we are talking about right now really is math and physics.

28
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:56,745
And it's incredibly useful math and physics

29
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:00,579
because it tells us how our quad moves in three-dimensions.

30
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,329
It tells us what a quad can and cannot do.

31
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,319
But the details of this math and physics are beyond the scope of this course.

32
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,560
So for now, understand that you don't need to memorize these equations.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,409
The important thing is that you can implement them, when you need to.

34
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:20,740
And now you will do exactly that.
