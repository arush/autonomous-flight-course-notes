1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,480
We're going to talk more about a couple of

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,435
the individual controllers in this architecture.

3
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:10,270
But for now, I want to help you understand some

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,675
of the thinking that went into the controller design.

5
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:16,340
On the left, we have a trajectory.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,490
For now, let's assume a trajectory contains target values for x,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,035
y, z, yaw angle,

8
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:24,325
and the associated velocities.

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:28,170
It could also contain acceleration targets.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,835
This trajectory gets split into three parts: a z part,

11
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:36,635
a lateral x and y part, and a yaw part.

12
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:40,905
The z trajectory is handled by the altitude controller.

13
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:46,425
The role of the altitude controller here is identical to what it was in the 2D case.

14
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:49,420
It sets the collective thrust.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,495
The x and y trajectory is first handled by the level position controller.

16
00:00:55,495 --> 00:01:00,320
This is almost identical to the y position controller from the 2D case.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,470
The only difference is that,

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,165
this controller outputs acceleration targets rather than angular targets.

19
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,640
But this was just a design decision so that we could keep

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,695
all the more complicated angular control logic in the roll-pitch controller.

21
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:20,335
Finally, the yaw trajectory is handled by the yaw controller.

22
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:25,050
Now, let's go into each of these path in more detail.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,065
Path one, altitude.

24
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:33,010
The altitude controller is responsible for ensuring the vehicle stays close to

25
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,390
the commanded set position and velocity by computing a target thrust value.

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,875
Now, note the inputs to the altitude controller,

27
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,740
everything related to the target and actual z,

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,935
plus it takes the quads current estimated attitude.

29
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:55,385
Intuitively, that's so that it can adjust its thrust when it's tilted.

30
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,870
And one more thing worth noting is that the output of

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,205
the altitude controller gets sent to the roll-pitch controller.

32
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:08,460
That's because the current commanded thrust is going to be shared in the x, y,

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,890
and z directions, and the portion that points in

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,600
the x and y will determine acceleration in those directions.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,540
The other input to the roll-pitch controller comes from the lateral position controller.

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,875
Paths to lateral position.

37
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:30,905
Controlling lateral position is the most involved control loop.

38
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,855
The position controller is pretty straightforward.

39
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:38,090
It is just a PD controller on the x and y trajectories,

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,555
similar to what we saw for Y in the 2D case.

41
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:45,750
It generates an acceleration command in the x and y directions,

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,440
which is sent to the roll-pitch controller.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,090
We have seen this cascaded structure before

44
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:57,670
a 2D and this roll-pitch controller is the most interesting of all of them.

45
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,710
Its job is to take a thrust command as well

46
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,610
as the desired x and y accelerations and the attitude,

47
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,990
pitch, roll, yaw, and p, q, r,

48
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,835
and output a target roll and pitch rate,

49
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:13,190
p command and q command.

50
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,230
These commanded p and q values get sent to the body rate controller.

51
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,260
The body rate control is just the p controller that converts p,

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,550
q, and r commands into three rotational moment commands.

53
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,730
The r commands come from the yaw controller.

54
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,895
Path three: Yaw.

55
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:37,790
As you can see, yaw is the least interesting of these loops and that's because it's

56
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,925
controlled through the reactive moment command and that command only affects yaw.

57
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,719
So yaw can really be treated almost in isolation.

58
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,155
In practice, if yaw does not matter for a specific application,

59
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:54,410
we often just try to keep the rate to zero and do not

60
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,970
even care about the exact yaw angle the vehicle is at.

61
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,840
By doing this, we ensure that all available thrust and

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,760
differential thrust is used for the translational motion that matters.
