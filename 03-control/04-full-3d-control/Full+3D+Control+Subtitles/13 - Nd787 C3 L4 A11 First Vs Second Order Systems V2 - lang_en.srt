1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,065
Before we jump into each of these individual blocks on this diagram,

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:07,290
it's important to point out that not every one of

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,664
these blocks will be filled with a PID or even a PD controller.

4
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:16,669
And that's because some of these blocks do not represent second order systems.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,290
Recall the control diagram from the previous lesson,

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,469
each of the blocks of this diagram represent the second order systems.

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,424
The altitude controller took a z target,

8
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:31,885
along with its first and second derivative as an input.

9
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:36,010
And as an output, it produced a thrust which maps directly to

10
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,574
an acceleration which is the second derivative of the input z.

11
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:43,720
Since this controller was responsible for hitting

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,155
a target z by commanding its second derivative,

13
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,939
this was a second order system.

14
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:54,489
To stably control a second order system without oscillations,

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,370
you need to have a PD controller at the very least.

16
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:03,655
Sometimes, an I term is also useful but it can often be safely ignored.

17
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:09,335
The other two blocks in the 2D control diagram represented second order systems as well.

18
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,204
For the 3D diagram,

19
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,899
that isn't the case.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,940
The altitude controller in 3D will still be

21
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,394
a PD controller since it's clearly a second order system.

22
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:22,450
But look at the yaw controller.

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:29,115
Its job is to take a yaw command as input and produce a yaw.command as output.

24
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:35,500
That's only a single derivative and that makes the yaw controller a first order system.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,204
And this means that the yaw controller will ultimately be

26
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:43,554
implemented as a key controller without any d term.

27
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:47,735
The yaw controller isn't the only first order system in this diagram.

28
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:51,060
The body rate controller and the role-pitch controller are

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,894
also first order systems which will be controlled with p controllers.

30
00:01:55,894 --> 00:02:01,679
The implementations of the yaw and body rate controllers will be pretty straightforward.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,580
The role-pitch controller will be more complex and

32
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,465
that's because the role-pitch controller is responsible for handling

33
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,590
all the mathematical realness associated with

34
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,194
transformations between the world and the body frames.

35
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,840
At this point, I want you to read through a couple of sections of

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,620
a paper which gives an overview of how this math works.

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,194
As you read through some of this paper,

38
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:30,829
keep an eye out for the first auto p control equation.
