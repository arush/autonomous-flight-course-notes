1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
When, you draw a box around all three of

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,710
these controllers and think of the inputs and outputs to this box,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,690
you can see that this box is really controlling second order systems.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:19,670
For example, yaw goes in as input and some moment is produced as output.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,895
Since that moment controls the second derivative of yaw,

6
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:27,475
that makes the whole thing a second order system.

7
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:30,920
Likewise, the roll-pitch and body rate

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,900
controllers together make up a second order system.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,490
The roll-pitch controller handles the first half of that system.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,740
The job of the roll-pitch controller is to take command at x,

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,665
y accelerations, a thrust,

12
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:47,360
and the vehicle's attitude,

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,665
and produce a roll rate command,

14
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:52,570
abbreviated P subscript c in the paper,

15
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,385
and a pitch rate command,

16
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,965
Q sub c. This is the first order system.

17
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:03,610
For our purposes, the key equations in this paper are equations two and six.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,490
Together, they represent some of the most complex math that you

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,590
will be implementing in Python and C++ in the final project.

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,505
Here, in equation two,

21
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:17,895
we start to see our control knobs for x and y emerging.

22
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,720
Here, in these equations,

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,245
c is the total commanded thrust,

24
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,905
and in this equation two,

25
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:27,030
we can see that the x acceleration, for instance,

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,050
is the product of this commanded thrust times this bx term.

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,280
It turns out that the x is the element in

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,435
the rotation matrix that must set in the body frame to x in the build frame.

29
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,685
This is just R13.

30
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:47,160
In effect, we are going to think of these elements in the rotation matrix,

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,450
R13 and R23, as the control knobs,

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,750
which are eventually going to control our x and y motion.

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,860
So, we want to command the value of these matrix elements,

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,765
but we need to know exactly how to do that.

35
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:07,845
Eventually, this controller needs to output commands for P and Q.

36
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:11,150
But we want to issue these commands by first,

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,980
setting targets for these matrix elements.

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,070
But how do we convert matrix element targets into P and Q commands?

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,645
Later in the paper,

40
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,080
in equation six, we are told how.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,755
This equation gives us a P command and a Q command,

42
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,405
which is what we want our controllers to output and it does so,

43
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,960
in terms of the rotation matrix elements on

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,665
the left multiplied by these other two terms on the right.

45
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:40,700
And you have to be a little persistent in reading

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,535
the paper to realize what these terms mean

47
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:48,250
because this is where the actual P controller code for

48
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,060
the first order system comes in and it does so through this equation.

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,975
And this equation is given in the paragraph just before equation six.

50
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:04,845
This tau rp is the time constant in the pitch and roll directions.

51
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,870
And this bx, remember,

52
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,555
is an element of the rotation matrix,

53
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:15,790
and bx with a c subscript is our commanded value of this rotation matrix element.

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,930
And this looks exactly like

55
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,320
the first order math that I showed you earlier for the yaw controller.

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,850
Now, if you are careful and put this all together just right,

57
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,530
you will have a nice controller,

58
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,100
which realizes x and y accelerations by properly

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,640
controlling the value of elements of the rotation matrix itself.
