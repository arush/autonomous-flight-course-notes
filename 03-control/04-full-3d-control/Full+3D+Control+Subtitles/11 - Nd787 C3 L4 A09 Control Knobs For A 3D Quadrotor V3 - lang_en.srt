1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
So, finally after understanding the 3D dynamics of a quadrotor,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,350
we can now think about controlling the vehicle.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,690
Lots of the ideas that we saw for

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,395
the 2D quad control are essential for 3D controller as well.

5
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:19,875
For example, we use the same cascaded PD or PID control structure.

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,280
We also need a non-linear transformation in order to

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,775
translate target accelerations to motor forces and torques.

8
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:31,720
Let's look at the 2D control from last lesson.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,090
A drone flying in the vertical plane with two propellers was an under actuated system.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,760
This meant we could only choose two quantities we wanted to control,

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,400
and then we have to use the dynamics to design a control knob for those quantities.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,815
For the 2D quad we wanted control knobs that could control Y and Z motion.

13
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:57,085
Our control knob for Z was the thrust.

14
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:01,900
In the non-linear case we had to increase the thrust when the vehicle was tilted.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,640
Our control knob for Y was less immediate.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,210
We had to first design a controller that linked phi to Y motion,

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,300
and then we designed a controller that linked the differential thrust to phi.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,660
In 3D, we want control over X, Y and Z.

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,185
So, we can move the quad where we want it in space.

20
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:28,060
Then we typically choose yaw as our fourth controllable state variable.
