1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Just like we did in 2D,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,015
we need to keep track of our vehicle's state,

3
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:08,905
but this time, we need 12 variables instead of six.

4
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:13,980
These variables specify the location of the vehicle as x, y, and z.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,900
They specify the orientation of the vehicle in Euler angles, for roll,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,880
pitch, and yaw, which we abbreviate with phi, theta, and psi.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,530
We use Euler angles here because they are intuitive.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,720
But we could equally use quaternions, for example,

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,515
or any other representation that describes orientation.

10
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:39,160
The 12 state variables also specify that x,

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,925
y, and z velocities,

12
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,610
which shouldn't be a surprise.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,355
And then finally, they need to specify rotation rates.

14
00:00:47,355 --> 00:00:49,280
For the 2D case,

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,325
that was a single quantity phi-dot.

16
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:57,570
In 3D, we must consider rotation rates about all three axes.

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,140
We will call them the body rates of the vehicle and the name is p, q,

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,710
r. Now, the important thing to note is that

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,945
these are not the same as phi-dot, theta-dot, and psi-dot.

20
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,630
And that's because the Euler angles phi,

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,830
theta, and psi are world frame coordinates.

22
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,880
To be precise, they describe the rotations

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,085
necessary to rotate the world frame into the body frame.

24
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,560
By the p, q, r variables,

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,300
give the angular rate of change of the vehicle in the body frame of the vehicle.

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,510
So p, q, r are the turn rates about the body x,

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,010
y, and z axis, respectively.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,290
These are the rotational velocities that would be

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,120
measured by a gyroscope mounted on the vehicle itself.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,065
It turns out, it is easier to work with p, q,

31
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:51,375
r than it is to work with Euler angle rates.

32
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:57,920
So tracking vehicles data looks similar in 2D and 3D with this one exception: p,

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,155
q, r are not the derivatives of phi, theta, and psi.

34
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,065
Next, we have step two,

35
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:10,065
figure out the forces and movements acting on the vehicle in the body frame.

36
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:14,590
Remember, these forces come from the rotation of the motors,

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,560
and in a body fixed frame,

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,835
the location of the motors are fixed which is to desirable.

39
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:24,290
All four motor forces point up in the frame of the body.

40
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,200
The net force in the body frame will be

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,660
the collective thrust from

42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,105
the four rotors and it will be negative in the z direction,

43
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:35,855
since down is positive and up is negative.

44
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:40,625
The net torque should be easy to calculate in the body frame as well,

45
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:44,670
because the orientation or attitude of the vehicle doesn't matter.

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,240
At this point, we have two separate mathematical paths we have to take.

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,560
We have to figure out translational motion from the forces,

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,940
and then on a separate path,

49
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,940
we are going to consider how the moments influenced the rotational motion,

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,245
that will be a little trickier.

51
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,870
So we've got three things on our to-do

52
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,675
list before we can really solve the 3D dynamics case.

53
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:14,260
One, figure out exactly how four propeller turn rates,

54
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,385
turn into a net force and three moments.

55
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:22,965
Two, track the influence of force on translational motion.

56
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:28,510
And three, track the influence of the three moments on rotational motion.

57
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,650
We will walk through the first two in programming activities,

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,150
and then we'll come back for a bit more explanation about number three.
