1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
You're about to start your first programming exercise for this lesson.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,870
But before you do, I want to walk through

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,685
this notebook and just make some points about it.

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:08,289
There are some differences between what we're

5
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:10,689
doing here and what we've been doing previously.

6
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:14,809
The first thing I want to point out is just how long this notebook actually is.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,109
All of these exercises are actually going to take place in the same notebook,

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,609
every single exercise for this lesson.

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,429
And what that means for you is that any changes you make to this notebook in,

10
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,219
for example, the next exercise,

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,669
they'll show up in all future exercises as well.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,730
So, what this means for you is that you should really

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,145
try to keep your code tidy if you can.

14
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:37,565
If you ever want to reset the notebook to where it began,

15
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:39,234
you can hit menu,

16
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:42,000
reset data, and go through this whole flow.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,024
But keep in mind, if you do that,

18
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,119
you'll lose all your work,

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,839
all the changes you made up to that point.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,210
So, just be careful. The second thing I

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,929
want to point out is some strange Jupyter notebook syntax.

22
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,969
So down here, you can see,

23
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,064
we defined a DroneIn3D class,

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,649
but we don't define the entire class in the cell.

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,589
In fact, in the cell, all we defined is the initializer.

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,734
Then we have some text and then down here,

27
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,689
we continue working on that same class.

28
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,609
We're adding to this DroneIn3D class and that's all that this syntax means.

29
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,260
So, don't be surprised when you see it.

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,035
The reason we're doing it this way is because it let's us

31
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,094
incrementally build up the class cell by cell.

32
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:23,269
Third thing I want to point out is how solutions are used in this notebook.

33
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:27,554
If you look here at this cell with all the imports, you see this line.

34
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:32,070
And in fact, UDACITYDroneIn3D and UDACITYController are actually

35
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,929
fully implemented versions of

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,305
the two classes that you will be implementing throughout this lesson.

37
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,340
And if you click up here on the Jupyter logo,

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,145
you could actually inspect that solution code by opening solution.py,

39
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:49,280
but you should try your best to solve these on your own before you do that.

40
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:53,719
So, let's go back down to this first class definition.

41
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:59,510
Here, you can see this DroneIn3D class actually inherits from the solution class.

42
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,390
And the reason we're doing it this way will be a

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,299
little more clear if we actually look at the first exercise.

44
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,009
So here, you can see exercise 1.1,

45
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,330
and this exercise actually already has a working implementation.

46
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,020
So, if I execute this cell and then run the testing cell,

47
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,460
you see test pass for exercise 1.1.

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,010
Now, the reason that worked is because what

49
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,269
this function is currently doing is just deferring to the super class implementation,

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,475
the solution class implementation of the same function.

51
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:30,329
What's nice about that is if you went through,

52
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,270
you could run this whole notebook and everything would actually work and

53
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,695
you would get a good sense for what it is you're going to be doing in this lesson.

54
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:39,310
But the only reason this code is passing is

55
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,909
because it's calling this super class implementation.

56
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,859
What you'll actually want to do when you get to these exercises is first,

57
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,290
maybe comment out the super class implementation and then start writing your code here.

58
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:57,049
You can see that if I comment out the super class and then rerun the cell,

59
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,660
the test isn't going to pass anymore.

60
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:02,039
All right, you're about ready to start exercise one.

61
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,620
In this exercise, you're going to

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,335
first define this set_propeller_angular_velocities function.

63
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:10,830
Then you'll write code to just calculate the rotation matrix.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,990
Then you'll use that rotation matrix to calculate

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,395
the linear acceleration of the drone regardless of what state it's in.

66
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,939
So now, you should go through,

67
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,719
complete those three exercises,

68
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,905
and once you get test pass here,

69
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:25,844
you can see it says, Exercise 1 ends here.

70
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,675
At that point, you should press "Next",

71
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,120
and continue with the lesson. Good luck.
