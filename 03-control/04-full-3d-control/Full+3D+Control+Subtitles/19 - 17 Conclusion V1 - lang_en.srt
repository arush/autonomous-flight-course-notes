00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
In this lesson, you've seen how we can break

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,380
a complex controls problem into a sequence of first and second order systems.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,390
And you've seen that second order systems can be controlled

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,480
with PD or with PID controllers.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,230
You've also seen how a second order system can

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,679
sometimes be controlled with two cascaded P controllers,

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,100
which each control a separate first order system.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,650
And in both cases,

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,289
there are going to be some physically meaningful parameters

10
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,259
that we can tune to adjust the behavior of the system.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,715
These ideas of cascaded control and first and second order systems apply in 2D as well.

12
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,185
The main thing that changed in going from

13
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:43,925
two to three dimensions was how we had to think about attitude and rotations.

14
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:45,765
That's right. In three dimensions,

15
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,375
we really have to think in both the body frame and the world frame,

16
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,850
and converting between the two introduces

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,520
a mathematical complexity that controller just has to handle.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,890
And just now, you saw how to use way points generated by

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,210
a 3D motion planner as input to a 3D quadrotor controller.

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,994
That means that you are ready for the final project for this course.

21
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:09,660
And this is a big deal.

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,715
Once you've completed this project,

23
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,049
you'll have implemented a large portion of

24
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,759
the full stack of a flying vehicle. Congratulations.
