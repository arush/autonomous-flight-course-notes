00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,650
Welcome back. In the first three lessons of this course,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:09,010
you've learned about quadrotor dynamics and quadrotor control in one and two dimensions.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,710
And remember what it means to

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,880
understand the dynamics of a quadrotor.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,950
It means that when we know the forces and the moments that are acting on the vehicle,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,155
we can predict what the state of the vehicle will be in the future.

7
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:23,150
That's right. And understanding the dynamics is

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,740
really helpful for solving the problem of vehicle control.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,600
When we solve a control's problem,

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,945
we go the other way.

11
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:35,540
We start with the desired motion and then we determine what forces and moments we need to

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,430
command to the vehicle based on

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,435
our current knowledge of the state of the vehicle compared to the target state.

14
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:45,920
And in this lesson, you're going to complete two major tasks.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,120
First, you're going to model the dynamics of

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,620
a 3D quadrotor by implementing an advanced state function.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,140
And once you've modeled the dynamics,

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,510
you'll learn how to solve the problem of three-dimensional control of a quadrotor.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,275
Now, this lesson won't require introducing any brand new controls concepts,

20
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:07,770
but some of the math is going to get a little trickier than it's been up till now.

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,065
But I promise, it will all be worth it.

22
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:12,005
Because at the end of this lesson,

23
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:17,460
you will be able to design a full controller that can actually control a real quadrotor.
