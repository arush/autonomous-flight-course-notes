1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
The vehicle would accelerate upwards because

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,634
the vehicle is lighter than the controller has assumed.

3
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:11,279
But what will happen to our position over time?

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,934
Remember, we are assuming that the target Z is just some constant altitude.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:21,750
We first need to integrate Z double dot to get velocity or

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,673
Z dot and then we integrate that with respect to time to get Z as a function of time.

7
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:33,363
With Z of zero being Z knot and Z dot of zero being zero,

8
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:37,905
the altitude was supposed to be Z knot forever.

9
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:44,189
But now, it grows quadratically with time and all because of a small error in the mass.

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:49,739
So the smallest error in our model can cause a huge mismatch

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,910
between what we think is happening based on our model and what actually happens.

12
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:59,629
This quadratic error appears anytime we have

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,515
a double integrator system like the one we have here.

14
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:08,075
We call a double integrator an unstable system.

15
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,460
A stable system would have

16
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:15,794
some self-correcting ability and the mismatch would not grow infinitely.

17
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:20,560
And it's important to note that these model errors are unavoidable.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,004
Our dynamics models are always an approximation of the real word.

19
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:31,030
Understanding and addressing errors is so important to control that

20
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,298
we actually have different words for different types of error.

21
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:38,870
The type of error you just saw is called a model error,

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,219
which just refers to an error in our model of the vehicle itself.

23
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,905
In this case, our model misrepresented the true mass of the vehicle,

24
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:52,969
but there are many ways our model can fail to account for the true dynamics.

25
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,844
Next, we have disturbances.

26
00:01:55,844 --> 00:02:01,454
These are errors caused by something external to the vehicle that we didn't anticipate.

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:07,170
For example, a strong crossbreeds would be a disturbance that could introduce error.

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,155
Finally, we have measurement noise.

29
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:14,775
Measurement noise refers to the unpredictable errors introduced

30
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:19,844
whenever we try to measure something about the quad or its environment.

31
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:25,449
You will learn a lot more about noise in particular in the next course on estimation.
