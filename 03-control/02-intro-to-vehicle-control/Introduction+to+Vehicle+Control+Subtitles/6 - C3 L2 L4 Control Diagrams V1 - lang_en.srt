1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,457
The controller you just worked with,

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,430
its known as an open loop controller.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,880
An open loop controller is a controller that doesn't

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,101
receive any feedback from the system it's controlling,

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:19,510
and this lack of feedback can make a simple control problem very difficult.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,800
As an example, consider getting out of bed in the morning,

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,840
and brushing your teeth.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,695
For you, this is probably not a hard problem to solve.

9
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:34,870
But if you were told to do it by wearing a blindfold,

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,720
it will probably be a lot harder. The lesson here,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,233
effective control requires feedback.

12
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,229
In the world of control theory,

13
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,575
we use block diagrams to visualize

14
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:52,130
important information about a controller and the system it controls.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,595
An open loop controller has a control diagram that looks like this.

16
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:02,690
For the controller, you just work with the system, was the drone.

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,975
The reference, was the target set location which was Z knot,

18
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:09,570
the input was the commanded thrust,

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,090
and the output was eventually,

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,610
the actual set location.

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,355
In general, the output describes what we can measure about the system.

22
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,080
If we can measure the velocity,

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,213
it would also include Z dot.

24
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,000
And as you saw,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,420
this doesn't produce a very effective controller because it lacks feedback,

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,320
which means, any errors will be unnoticed and are able to grow unchecked.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,361
To turn this into a closed loop controller,

28
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,210
we need a diagram that looks like this.

29
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,410
And if you look down here,

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,835
you'll see that we are using a sensor to measure the output of the system,

31
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:54,540
and we are feeding that measured signal back,

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,280
and comparing it with the target value, the reference signal.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,058
This circular thing is called a summing junction,

34
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:05,140
and the plus and minus signs are used to indicate that

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,970
the arrow which this junction produces comes from the reference,

36
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,435
minus the measured output.

37
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:17,230
You might see these summing junctions in some of the control diagrams,

38
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,890
but sometimes they are also just omitted.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,613
In these block diagrams,

40
00:02:22,613 --> 00:02:27,390
arrows represent signals, and the boxes are functions or equations.

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,000
For example, the system block represents our model equation.
