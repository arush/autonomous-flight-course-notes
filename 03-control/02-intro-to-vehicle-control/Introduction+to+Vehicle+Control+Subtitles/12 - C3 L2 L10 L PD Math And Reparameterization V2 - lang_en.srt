1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
So far, we have this as our controller equation and we

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,419
can interpret this as saying the best control to command right now

3
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,859
is whatever the current target acceleration is plus some correction for

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:19,064
any error in velocity plus some correction for any error in position.

5
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:23,370
We can also see that Kp and Kd must be positive for

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,859
the corrections to be effective and for the system to remain stable over all.

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,660
But how do we decide how big these corrections should be?

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,115
Written like this, these coefficients Kp and Kd don't tell us

9
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:40,734
much and I don't know how to tune them to get good behavior.

10
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,149
But there's a way to rewrite this equation so that

11
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,494
the coefficients have more physical significance.

12
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:49,419
I'm going to walk through the mass now,

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,769
and then afterwards, you'll have a chance to play around with these ideas in code.

14
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:58,539
The first thing I want to do is write this equation like this.

15
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:04,385
And now, I can see that these terms in parentheses are just the derivatives of the error.

16
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:07,245
If you've ever studied differential equations,

17
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:10,454
then you have seen very similar equations before.

18
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:14,700
In fact, this looks like the equation for mass on a spring with

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,510
some damping term and the resulting motion is a damped oscillation,

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,378
which just means the motion has sinusoidal oscillation,

21
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:27,150
whose amplitude is modified by a decaying exponential.

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,874
Let me show you what I mean.

23
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:32,834
I'm using a tool called desmos to show graphs here.

24
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,704
Here, I've defined a function f,

25
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:41,745
which is just the cosine of omega t. And you can see that when I increase omega,

26
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:44,250
I increase the rate of oscillation.

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,579
So, this is pure oscillatory behavior.

28
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,650
I can turn that off and we can look at pure decay.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,590
And here, you can see a graph of e to

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,335
the minus delta omega t and this is pure exponential decay.

31
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,637
And if I slide this delta,

32
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:07,960
you can see that I can control how fast this decay happens.

33
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,680
But the actual error as a function of time like the position of a mass

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,090
on a spring will display both of these behaviors simultaneously.

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,810
So down here, I've defined this third function h,

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,634
which is the product of the oscillation and the decay.

37
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:26,883
Let me turn that on now.

38
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:32,224
As you can see, we are left with this oscillation which is modulated by decay.

39
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:35,239
This wouldn't be the worst error for a flying vehicle.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,659
But honestly, we'd like the error to converge to zero much

41
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,799
faster and we would rather not have so much oscillation.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,670
Luckily, I can correct for that.

43
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,189
Now, I can modify my delta and my omega.

44
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,495
And since I have some intuitive sense of what those parameters do,

45
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:56,455
I can more easily tweak how the error will behave over time.

46
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,650
It turns out that when you solve this equation,

47
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,409
you find that Kp is just the square of

48
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,275
that natural frequency omega and Kd is two times delta times omega.

49
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:11,050
In practice, when you tune your controllers,

50
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,640
it is helpful to think of these coefficients instead of Kp and Kd.
