1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
So, how do we get rid of these oscillations?

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:07,463
The key is to add one more term to our controller equation.

3
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:10,155
And remember, for the purposes of this lesson,

4
00:00:10,154 --> 00:00:13,454
the controller sets a commanded acceleration.

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:18,097
So, in addition to setting acceleration in proportion to the error,

6
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:20,009
we also look at the rate of change,

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,140
or derivative of the error.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,010
And the subscript d here stands for derivative.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,588
And this equation is the equation for a PD or proportional derivative controller.

10
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:36,909
The intuition behind this d term is pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,574
While the p term is responsible for adjusting the thrust

12
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:44,566
so that the vehicle's position matches the target position,

13
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:47,670
the d term is responsible for adjusting the thrust,

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,530
so that the vehicle's velocity matches the target velocity.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,780
So, when the vehicle is rapidly ascending towards this target set,

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,024
this term will oppose this rapid decrease in the size of the error,

17
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:07,890
and will cause the vehicle to slow down as it's approaching the target altitude.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,007
To implement this in code,

19
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,558
recall how we've defined error.

20
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:15,545
This means that the derivative of error is

21
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:19,920
just the difference between the target speed and the actual speed.
