00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
Welcome back. So, what are we going to learn in this lesson Angela?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:08,460
In this lesson, we are going to learn how to make a quadrotor do what we want it to do.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,370
And this may be as simple as hovering in the air.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,930
But in the last lesson,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,180
we already learned how to model the vehicle dynamics.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,875
Shouldn't hovering just be as simple as

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,200
the upward thrust needs to balance the downwards weight?

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,819
Not exactly.

9
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:23,460
Our model was the simplification of the real world.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,030
And if we try to use only that model to control the drone,

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,740
it would crash pretty quickly.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,940
Okay. So, if our model of vehicle dynamics isn't enough, what else do we need to do?

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,020
What we really need to do,

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,544
is to actively control the vehicle.

15
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:41,700
And not only think about what the drone should be doing based on our models,

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,075
but also pay attention to what it actually is doing,

17
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,770
and make constant adjustments.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,390
Okay. Sounds good. Let's get started.
