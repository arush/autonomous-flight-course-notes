1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
One way of thinking about the controller problem is this.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,459
Given a desire trajectory,

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,669
find the continuous sequence of

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,875
propeller rotation rates that will cause the drone to fly along that trajectory.

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:18,734
A trajectory is a sequence of 3D positions and yaw,

6
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:23,629
and associated times at which you want to be at that position and yaw.

7
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:28,884
In this lesson, you've worked on a similar but reversed version of the problem.

8
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:35,795
In fact, the problem you know how to solve now is best described by this.

9
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:39,575
Given a continuous sequence of propeller rotation rates,

10
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:43,210
predict the trajectory that the drone will fly.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:48,835
And you solve this for the 2D case when you implemented the advanced state function.

12
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,600
And solving this problem isn't trivial.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
Starting with nothing but an ability to set

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,454
the rotational rates of the propellers, you had to do,

15
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:04,799
one, know how those rotational rates lead to thrusts and moments about the X,

16
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,159
Y and Z body axis.

17
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,219
Two, know how thrusts and moments affect the acceleration and rotation of the vehicle.

18
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,569
And three, know how accelerations when

19
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:23,484
integrated twice affect the actual position and orientation of the vehicle.

20
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,030
And then, on top of that,

21
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,112
you had to implement all of that in code. Good job.

22
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,609
In the next lesson,

23
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:36,530
you'll learn how to use something called a PID controller to go the other way,

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,590
and convert a desire trajectory into a continuous sequence of

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,000
rotor commands that actually control a drone to track the target trajectory.
