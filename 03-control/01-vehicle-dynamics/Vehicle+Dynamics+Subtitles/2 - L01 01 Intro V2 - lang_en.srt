00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Welcome to the first lesson of controls.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,849
This lesson is called Vehicle Dynamics.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,334
My name is Angela Schoellig and I will be your instructor for this course.

4
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,490
And my name is Andy Brown and I'll be

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,115
popping in occasionally to explain a concept or two,

6
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,469
but mostly I'll be helping you as you work through

7
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,003
the programming exercises that you'll encounter throughout this course.

8
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:24,269
So, Angela, can you explain what do we mean when we talk about vehicle dynamics?

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,864
Well, dynamics is concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces.

10
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,205
So for our purposes,

11
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:34,769
vehicle dynamics means understanding how the rotation of

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,900
the drone's four propellers creates

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,429
forces and how these forces generate motion of the vehicle.

14
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,015
And in this lesson,

15
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:44,100
you'll be learning how to model these forces

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,460
mathematically in Python and then you'll use those models

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,710
to advance the current state of the vehicle into

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,380
the future to actually predict the motion of flying vehicles.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,695
Exactly, and there are plenty of reasons why we need to build these models.

20
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,579
But from a control standpoint,

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,820
having a good dynamic model of the vehicle allows us to

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,379
intelligently influences the output of the vehicle by properly setting the inputs.

23
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:13,189
And what do we mean when we talk about inputs and outputs for something like a drone?

24
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,536
Right. So for a drone,

25
00:01:14,537 --> 00:01:16,880
the input would be the rotation rates of

26
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,619
the four propellers and the output would be the resulting motion of the vehicle.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,090
Sounds good. Let's get started.
