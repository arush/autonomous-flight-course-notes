1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,474
Now, we'd like to describe the full two-dimensional motion of the vehicle.

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:09,649
We've discussed how a rotor that's turning clockwise,

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,580
will introduce a counter-clockwise moment about the axis of rotation.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,509
And we call this reaction moment,

5
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,980
because it's a rotational moment that is

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,725
an opposite reaction to some other rotational motion.

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:27,530
But reaction moments only explain yaw.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,520
What about pitch and roll?

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,412
When the left rotors produce more stress than the right rotors,

10
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:42,034
the quad rotor will experience a clockwise acceleration.

11
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:45,125
And that's because the rotors on the left side,

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,439
produce a clockwise moment which is bigger than

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,820
the counter-clockwise moment produced by the rotors on the right side.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,670
The moment that causes this rotation is

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,520
slightly different than the reaction moment that causes yaw.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,540
This torque comes from a force that acts perpendicular to the axis of rotation,

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,635
at some distance from the center of the vehicle.

18
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,850
And the magnitude of this torque,

19
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:16,089
is found by multiplying this perpendicular distance by that force.

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,765
The example torque calculations below this video,

21
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:23,180
should make this calculation a little more clear.
