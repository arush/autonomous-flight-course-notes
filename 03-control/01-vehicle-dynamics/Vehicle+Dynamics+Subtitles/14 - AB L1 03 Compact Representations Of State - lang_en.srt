1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,194
So this is my solution to the advanced state function.

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:04,620
And when I look through this code,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,345
I actually see a lot of repetition.

4
00:00:06,344 --> 00:00:11,550
And in particular, this code looks a lot like this code,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,785
which looks a lot like this code,

6
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,100
which looks a lot like this code.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,575
And in fact we have four of these repetitive blocks of code,

8
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:21,689
one for each of our state variables,

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,725
and each of them is doing essentially the same thing.

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,190
They're taking some quantity,

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,095
multiplying it by dt,

12
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:33,259
and using this result to update some other quantity.

13
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:36,299
It would be nice to have a more compact representation of this state than

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,989
just using these four separate state variables and updating each independently.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,960
So what we're going to do is we're going to think in

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,710
terms of state vectors instead of state variables.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,020
So here, first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get rid of

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,730
these four variables, four state variables,

19
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,039
we're going to place them with

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,530
a single state vector which I'm going to call upper case X,

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,395
and it's just going to be an np.array with four values in it,

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,975
and these values correspond to z,

23
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:07,329
psi, z_dot, and psi_dot.

24
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,409
And what's going to be nice about representing state this way,

25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,104
is if we do things right,

26
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,710
we're going to be able to update all of these quantities all at once.

27
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:18,149
So instead of this version of advanced state,

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,760
we're going to use this version of advanced state.

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,605
And in this version we just have this one vector called capital X_dot.

30
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:30,795
And we multiply this X_dot vector by this dt,

31
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:35,730
the amount of seconds we're advancing the state forward to get a single delta x,

32
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,630
which represents how all those state variables change all at once and then we

33
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,265
say the new state is just the old state plus this delta x.

34
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:48,114
And so written now, in terms of math which is probably a little easier to think about,

35
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:50,759
we have this updated state vector which is z, z_dot, psi,

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,060
psi_dot prime, which is just equal to

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,650
the old state vector plus dt times the corresponding derivatives for each of these.

38
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,920
And this is a pretty slick way of doing this state update,

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,070
and it's something you'll see more of in later lessons.

40
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:06,629
And honestly now, at this point,

41
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,289
we've said just about everything there is to say about this coaxial copter.

42
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,459
Now, we're going to move to

43
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,000
a more complex vehicle where the two propellers are side by side.
