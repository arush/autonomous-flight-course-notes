00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,544
If the weight vector of a monorotor is 100 newtons down,

2
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,314
then if it's hovering,

3
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:09,390
the thrust must be 100 newtons up.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,429
To calculate the mass of this mono rotor we have to remember that weight is

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,054
a product of mass and the acceleration due to gravity, which is 9.81.

6
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:26,681
So 100 divided by 9.81 would give a mass of about 10.2 kilograms,

7
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,429
which means this is a pretty big quadrotor.

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,949
The last question was a little tricky,

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,144
and was really meant to get you thinking.

10
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:40,865
But actually, it's impossible for a monorotor to sit truly motionless in the sky.

11
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:46,565
And that's because a monorotor can never be in what's called rotational equilibrium.

12
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:52,920
At this point, I'd like to show you a video of what an actual monorotor can look like.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,679
As you watch, notice the rotation of the monorotor's body.
