1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
In order to claim that I understand the dynamics of a system like the CoaxialCopter,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,419
I need to be able to the track,

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,730
the motion of that system over time.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,544
So at this point the first thing I need to do,

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,480
is make some changes right in

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,495
the initializer so that I can actually track the state of the system.

7
00:00:15,494 --> 00:00:17,175
So I need to add some state variables,

8
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:21,135
and I'm going to add a variable for Z and psi.

9
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm going to start those both off with values of zero.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,620
Now, I want to advance these state variables forward in time by

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,350
however much dt time I want and I'm going to

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,469
do that in a method called advanced state uncontrolled.

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,109
And this uncontrolled, this just

14
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,554
emphasizes that what we're doing is we're pretending like the rotors aren't spinning,

15
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,759
that this copter is just in free fall.

16
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,534
It's actually not that useful of a function,

17
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,669
but I'm really just walking through the logic of how I think through

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,510
it so that you can implement the advanced state function yourself.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,894
So the first thing I want to do in this function, well,

20
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:58,173
I want to realize that there's not going to be any rotational acceleration.

21
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:59,310
If the rotors aren't turning,

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,560
there's not going to be any torque on the system,

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,030
not any moment on the system,

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,325
and so there's not going to be any rotational acceleration.

25
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,859
So the first thing I have to do is only figure out

26
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,334
the linear acceleration of the systems, z_dot_dot.

27
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,184
And for a quadrotor,

28
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:15,765
or I should say a coaxial copter under free fall,

29
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,329
that would just be the acceleration due to gravity.

30
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,884
Now I have to think, what is this acceleration actually do to the system?

31
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:26,510
Well remember, I'm advancing the state forward by dt seconds.

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,000
And acceleration over time changes a velocity.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,525
So a change in velocity alright is delta_z_dot,

34
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:39,600
and that's just going to be equal to z_dot_dot times this dt.

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,750
This change in velocity is actually reminding

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,709
me that I haven't written enough state variables up here.

37
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,879
It's not enough to just know Z and psi,

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:55,042
I also have to track z_dot and psi_dot.

39
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:59,070
And together these four comprise my state variables,

40
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,959
Z, psi and their derivatives.

41
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,208
So the new velocity,

42
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,575
vertical velocity of the system is equal to the old vertical velocity,

43
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:10,890
plus whatever the changes.

44
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,024
So just as I went through the process of figuring out how z_dot_dot changed z_dot,

45
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:21,105
now I have to figure out how the velocity changes the position.

46
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:27,405
Well, a velocity over time causes the delta_z. Just like this.

47
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:33,409
And this delta_z, gets just directly added to update my new Z value.

48
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,620
So my Z value is just the old Z value plus the change.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,620
So I am going to execute the cell and

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,289
then that takes me down to this next cell right here,

51
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,634
which is just a bit of logic to actually

52
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:50,629
plot the course of the vehicle over two seconds of flight in the air,

53
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,259
or I should say two seconds of freefall.

54
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:54,259
So let's execute this cell,

55
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,664
and this is what I get.

56
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,549
And this plot looks pretty consistent for what the vertical position

57
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,459
should be doing overtime for an object in freefall.

58
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:07,344
Now, you should write the actual advanced state function.

59
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:09,199
And this one is going to be different in a couple of ways.

60
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,944
One, it's going to have to take into account what the rotors are doing.

61
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,780
And two, because the rotors are now doing something,

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,169
that's going to introduce the potential for a moment on the system,

63
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,000
which means you are going to have to track the change in rotational motion as well.
