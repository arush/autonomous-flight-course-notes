1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
In this exercise, you were asked to implement

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,050
three methods of this CoaxialCopter class.

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,699
The first was this z_dot_dot method,

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,264
and that just returned the current vertical acceleration

5
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:13,995
based on whatever the propellers were doing.

6
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:16,353
Then, you were asked to calculate the psi_dot_dot,

7
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:19,859
which is the rotational acceleration about the Z axis,

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,570
and then this function set-rotors-angular-velocities,

9
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:28,710
in this function, you actually set the correct angular rotation rates for each of

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,120
the propellers based on

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,325
whatever linear acceleration and angular acceleration you wanted the vehicle to have.

12
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:37,145
Now to show you how I solved this,

13
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:40,905
I want to show you a technique you can use in this and in future notebooks,

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:44,480
which is, first you click on this Jupyter icon up here in the top left.

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,875
And that takes you to this navigation page.

16
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,924
And you can see here, all of the notebooks for this lesson are at this navigation page.

17
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:56,184
Here I have coaxial drone dynamic solution, so I can click into that.

18
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:59,385
And if I scroll down to the CoaxialCopter class,

19
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:04,030
sure enough I will see that I have an implemented version of this z_dot_dot function.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,825
And let me walk you through how this implementation works.

21
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,335
So first, step one, calculate the forces.

22
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:11,873
And for each propeller,

23
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,689
that was just k_f times omega squared.

24
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:18,649
Next, I had to calculate the force of gravity, the weight force,

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,600
and that's just M times G. Now to sum up this total force,

26
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,669
I had to be a little careful,

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,210
I had to remember that Z pointing down is positive,

28
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,214
so f_g is the positive one here,

29
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,230
and f_1 and f_2 are both negative,

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,695
and then the acceleration is just the total force divided by the mass.

31
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,569
So, that's what we want to return it.

32
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,069
The thinking is pretty similar for the psi_dot_dot,

33
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,544
so I'm not going to walk through that yet.

34
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,480
But this one's a little more interesting,

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,195
and really, there's a bunch of math going on here,

36
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:47,684
and I don't want to walk through actually solving out this math,

37
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:50,710
but I do want to point you to what equations this math came from.

38
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:54,939
And if I scroll up, you can see these two equations are the ones we really care about.

39
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,289
Remember that set rotors function,

40
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,454
it took a z_dot_dot and the psi_dot_dot as arguments,

41
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:04,034
so these are fixed for that function's point of view.

42
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:07,019
So now we have these two equations with two unknowns.

43
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,055
Omega one is unknown,

44
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,375
and Omega two is unknown.

45
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,150
If you solve these equations for those variables,

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,205
you'll find the math that you need to implement

47
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:17,150
to actually implement the function correctly.

48
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,835
Next, you're going to actually implement a function called advanced state,

49
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:24,010
which actually tracks the state of the vehicle over time.

50
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,384
And when you can implement a function like advanced state,

51
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:30,680
you've really proven that you understand the dynamics of the system,

52
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,670
because if you can advance the state forward in time,

53
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,000
well that means you understand how all the forces impact the motion of the vehicle.
