1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
In the last project, you implemented

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,835
event-driven programming to control a quadrotor in simulation.

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:09,450
You gave your quad a set of instructions to follow: takeoff,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,055
assent to a particular altitude,

5
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,410
fly a specific path, then land.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,200
In doing this, you executed your first flight plan.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,960
Nice work. Now, we're going to dive into

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,840
the details of constructing more complicated flight plans.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,650
And in the next project, you'll implement a motion planning algorithm that allows you

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,020
to automatically generate a flight plan using a 3D map of the world.
