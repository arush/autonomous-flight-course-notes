1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
We now have a notion of cost,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:05,955
a function that provides a measure of how good or bad a partial plan is.

3
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:10,004
We can start to add in some guidance about how to make progress towards the goal.

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,500
Given a map of the world,

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,754
I can make a rough estimate of how far it is,

6
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:16,260
or in other words, how much it's going to cost to get

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,060
from the last state in any given partial plan to the goal.

8
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,599
In much the same way, you decide which way to go

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,650
when walking through the city on your way to your destination.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,299
There are a couple of common ways to do this.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,824
One example is estimating that the remaining cost to get to the goal,

12
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:35,100
is the euclidean distance from the last state in the partial plan to the goal state.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,905
In our grid world, that looks like this.

14
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,085
Now, the value in each cell is the euclidean distance to the goal,

15
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:45,395
or in other words, the square root of the sum of the square of the x and y distances.

16
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,220
Such an estimate ignores obstacles,

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,899
and is going to be an underestimate,

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,030
but it will tell you whether the last state in

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,179
the partial plan is making progress towards the goal,

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,979
because progress means that the euclidean distance will get smaller and smaller.

21
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,559
Similarly, if you're moving away from the goal,

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,990
the euclidean distance will get larger.

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,615
Another common choice is the so called Manhattan distance,

24
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:10,814
which is just the sum of the x and y distances remaining to get to the goal.

25
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:14,879
The name comes from assuming you need to move through your grid based discritization,

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,560
like you would move through the city of Manhattan.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,609
Lineally along the streets to form square blocks.

28
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,849
These distance estimates are what are known as heuristics,

29
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,019
and they help tremendously in finding a solution to the planning problem efficiently.

30
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:31,875
Your heuristic estimate doesn't have to be perfect,

31
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,545
but it does need to have one important property,

32
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:39,375
which is that it does need to always be an underestimate of the true cost.

33
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:44,060
This property of being an underestimate is known as being admissible.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,225
One way to ensure that your heuristic is admissible is to ignore obstacles,

35
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:52,219
which is to say ignore the cost of going around obstacles.

36
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,852
The important thing about being at admissible heuristic,

37
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:59,459
is that if we incorporate the heuristic into our notion of the total cost of a plan,

38
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,250
they will never ignore plans or fail to expand plans,

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,230
because we overestimated their cost,

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,825
which ensures that we'll always find the lowest cost plan from start to goal.

41
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,149
We've got a cost function and a heuristic.

42
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,000
It's time to combine them to solve our planning problem.
