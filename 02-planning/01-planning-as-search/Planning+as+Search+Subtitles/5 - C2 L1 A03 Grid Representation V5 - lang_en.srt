1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,905
What's the simplest representation I could choose for a search space?

2
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:07,775
Well, for starters, I'm going to ignore the vehicle's orientation.

3
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,320
I'll assume that the attitude of the vehicle doesn't matter,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,095
and the vehicle is capable of moving in any direction at any point in time.

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:18,005
For now, I'll just consider a top-down two dimensional view of the world.

6
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,340
Then, I can put down

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,995
a regular grid-based discretization over the flight volume of the vehicle.

8
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:25,115
But now, I have a design issue,

9
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,630
which is how big to make the grid cells.

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,930
And that creates some issues in terms of how

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,435
computationally complex the planning problem is.

12
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:34,175
If I use a really fine grid,

13
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,795
I get better resolution of obstacles and freespace,

14
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:40,545
but solving the planning problem will be more computationally expensive.

15
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:43,430
If instead, I use a very coarse discretization.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,800
I reduced computation time,

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,230
but might risk losing too much information regarding potential solutions.

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,190
Let me choose a grid resolution that seems to give

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,260
the right balance between resolution and speed,

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,560
and then I need to decide how I want to incorporate obstacles into this representation.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,840
A common way to do this is to say that any

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,035
grid cell that contains an obstacle or part of an obstacle,

23
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:10,425
I'll label as off limits or infeasible shown here in red.

24
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:13,580
Now, the vehicle won't be allowed to enter these cells.

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,215
I'll label all the remaining grid cells as free space.

26
00:01:16,215 --> 00:01:17,765
And that means that the plan,

27
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,905
given this representation, is a sequence of grid cells through the frees pace.

28
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:25,610
Those that don't contain obstacles from the start state to the goal state.

29
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,390
I now have the first three things I need for defining the search space.

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,990
I have my grid-based representation of the world, my start state,

31
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,805
which is whatever grid cell the vehicle happens to be in at the beginning of the mission,

32
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,935
and my goal state, which is

33
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:44,010
whatever grid cell contains the goal location for this mission.

34
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,065
The next thing I need is the action set.

35
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,990
Actions are, in this case,

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,120
whatever moves this from one grid cell to the next grid cell.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,000
In a grid-based representation like this,

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,715
I can consider actions that move the vehicle right,

39
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,725
left up, or down,

40
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,340
or even diagonal motions,

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,865
if I want to allow for more complex plans.

42
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,190
The last thing I need is a cost function.

43
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,820
And to start with, I'll just choose something super simple.

44
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,180
I'll assume that every action has the same cost. A cost of one.

45
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,755
And with that, I have a complete representation of the problem.

46
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:19,145
But notice that I'm giving something up with this very simple representation.

47
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:23,070
There are going to be certain kinds of plans that I might not be able to capture.

48
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,220
For instance, if I have a course discretization where grid cells are relatively big,

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,085
and I have a small obstacle spanning several cells.

50
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:34,025
I'm going to label all those cells as infeasible.

51
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:38,055
Even though there may be a path that is feasible through those grid cells.

52
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:41,885
As a designer, when it comes to choosing a search space representation,

53
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:46,250
you have fundamental decisions to make in terms of how to discretize the world,

54
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,480
what actions are allowed,

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,000
and what the costs are that are associated with each action.
