00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome to 3D motion planning.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,780
It's all about a drone finding it's way about it's environment.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,430
In the beginning we are going to cheat a little bit and start in

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,820
2D, learning about an algorithm called A star search.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,080
Later, we're going to analyze this into 3D so drones find their way around.
