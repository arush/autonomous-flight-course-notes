00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
Okay, I've said that in our simple grid world example,

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,580
a plan is a sequence of states from the start state to the goal state.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,599
How do I build that plan?

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,974
The process of building a plan is the essence of the search process.

5
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:16,649
The way that I'm going to conduct a search is by taking a partial plan,

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,750
applying an action, and adding

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,115
the resulting state to the end of the previous plan to get a new partial plan.

8
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:25,109
Let's look at an example.

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,890
Imagine that we have a simple 2D grid world

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,570
and we have a start state and we have a goal state.

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,740
And we start with a very simple initial plan of just being at the start state.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,395
One state sequence is still a sequence.

13
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:41,560
Now, let's imagine that I only have one possible action which is to move right,

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,300
and so I always apply the same action.

15
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:46,859
I take my initial partial plan of being at the start state,

16
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,269
and I move right and end up here.

17
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,179
That's a new partial plan.

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,854
It doesn't get me all the way to the goal but it is a partial plan.

19
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,579
Let's do the same thing over again.

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,379
Apply my action, I end up with this state.

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,945
Now, I have a new partial plan.

22
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,935
Start, right, right.

23
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:07,510
I do that a couple more times and I end up with a plan that looks like start state,

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,715
right, right, right Goals state.

25
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,120
That's a successful plan.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,910
Now, it's a silly plan because I only ever considered moving right.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,765
And I got lucky that I didn't have to turn or go around any obstacles.

28
00:01:19,765 --> 00:01:21,375
The next thing we want to look at is,

29
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,000
how do we incorporate the other actions that we might need to

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,670
take in order to get more complicated plans,

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,000
and plans that move around obstacles?
