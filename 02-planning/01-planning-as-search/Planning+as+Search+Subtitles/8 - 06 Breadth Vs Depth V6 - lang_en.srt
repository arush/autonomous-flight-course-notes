1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,359
Throughout the process of building out a plan,

2
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:04,730
I'm maintaining a list of partial plans and

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,530
expanding each one of them one by one to update my list.

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,889
The thing to think about now is,

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,200
which is the best choice for the next partial plan to

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,834
expand from the list of partial plans I have so far?

7
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:18,045
Well, there are a few options here.

8
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:20,645
If, for example, I prefer shorter plans,

9
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,699
then the best choice is to always expand

10
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:26,530
the shortest plan that I have so far in my list of partial plans.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,550
The process of always choosing to expand

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,699
the shortest partial plan is called Breadth-First Search.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,460
This algorithm has the nice property that it's guaranteed to find

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,984
the shortest path from start to goal first before any other paths.

15
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,289
That means that as soon as you find a plan from the start to the goal,

16
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,894
you know you've found the shortest one.

17
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:48,880
One other wrinkle is that we should modify how our visited list works.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,315
If you think about how Breadth-First Search works,

19
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:54,214
if we extend a partial path from some state,

20
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:57,170
it must not only be the lowest cost path on the stack,

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,429
but it must also represent the lowest cost path to that state.

22
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,879
We don't actually know which partial path is the lowest cost path to

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,634
a state until we take the partial path off the stack ending in that state.

24
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:13,400
The modification to our visited list is therefore the only label a state as

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,770
visited once we pick a partial path off

26
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,250
the stack and create new partial paths from that state.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,394
While Breadth-First Search has this nice property of finding the shortest path,

28
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:26,839
the downside is that it can end up keeping around an awful lot of

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,655
partial plans as it's trying to expand the path away from the start towards the goal.

30
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,704
It can be very intensive in terms of memory or

31
00:01:33,704 --> 00:01:36,799
storage which could be computationally costly too.

32
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,869
Another approach is to simply expand

33
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,200
a partial plan using some action and if that action is successful,

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,609
keep applying that action to try to make progress towards the goal.

35
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,840
Kind of like you saw in a previous example when I

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,260
kept expanding the plan using just the move right action.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,140
That particular approach is called Depth-First Search.

38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,019
The problem with Depth-First Search is that while it works really

39
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,375
well if you get lucky and find a good action to keep using,

40
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:03,155
you never know when you find a successful plan to the goal if

41
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:07,079
that's the shortest possible plan or the best plan in any sense.

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,859
And sometimes, you can be really unlucky and keep

43
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,960
successfully applying an action but not making any progress towards the goal.

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,930
What we would like to do is devise a method that's sort of a hybrid of Breadth-First and

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,025
Depth-First Search and then takes advantage of the fact that in motion planning problems,

46
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,170
especially for things like flying cars.

47
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:26,809
We actually have some information about

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,199
which direction we need to go in order to make progress towards the goal,

49
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,905
which is to say, we have a map.

50
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,990
And we should be using that knowledge of

51
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,379
our environment in deciding which partial plan to expand next.
