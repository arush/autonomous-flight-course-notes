00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
In this lesson, we covered the foundations of solving the planning problem.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,770
You looked at how to set up your search space which involve discretizing the world

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,910
into a set of individual states with a start and goal state for your vehicle.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,855
You defined actions that describe how your vehicle moves from state to state.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:19,635
And finally, you assigned a cost to each action that describes how

6
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:23,630
difficult or complex each action is relative to all the others.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,695
After that, we looked at heuristics for estimating

8
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:30,520
the total cost remaining from the last state of a partial plan to the goal.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,140
With a cost function and a heuristic that was both admissible and consistent in hand,

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,930
you implemented the famous A* algorithm to

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,005
utilize a map of the world to make your search more efficient.

12
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,090
These concepts are really at the heart of

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,750
any autonomous system when it comes to solving the planning problem,

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,120
but this is just the beginning.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,570
Next up, we'll be looking at how to represent your vehicle within

16
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,380
the search space and other clever ways of discretizing your world.
