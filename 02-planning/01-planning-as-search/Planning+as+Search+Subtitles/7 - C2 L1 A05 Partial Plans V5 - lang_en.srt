00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,594
Let's go back to our grid world example where I have my start state and my goal state.

2
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,869
But now, let's put an obstacle right in the middle.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,099
What happens now is that grid cell becomes infeasible.

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,015
I have my array in memory of all my grid cells where zeros indicate

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:20,070
freespace and ones are infeasible space and that one cell is now labeled as infeasible,

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,594
which means that actions are not allowed to move into that cell.

7
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,085
Let's run the same planning process as before.

8
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:29,420
I take my initial partial plan, just the start state,

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,719
and I apply the action of moving one step to the right and I end up here.

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,170
Very good. I have a new partial plan just as I did before,

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,890
start state right here.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,965
If I try to apply the same action to move right again

13
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:46,445
I now run into the obstacle here. What do I do now?

14
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:51,619
Well, really, what I should be doing is every time I expand a partial plan I should

15
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,614
be expanding all possible actions and expanding any partial plan gives me,

16
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,200
in this 2D example,

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,560
as many as four new partial plans because I have

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
four actions or if there's an obstacle in the way,

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,640
I don't get as many.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,909
What I should have done, is it when I tried to expand my partial plan from the start,

21
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,479
is not just create a partial plan for moving right,

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,000
but also create partial plans that move left,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,534
move up, move down from start as well.

24
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,759
Then from here, I should have had plans that moved up and

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,710
down as well as a plan that tried to move into the obstacle and failed.

26
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,934
Really, what I'm doing is I'm constructing a list of partial plans as I go,

27
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,275
and every time I want to consider a new plan,

28
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,685
I pick one partial plan from my list and I

29
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:36,109
apply all feasible actions to the last state of that partial plan.

30
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,689
Through that process, I get a new set of

31
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,465
partial plans to add to my list of possible plans.

32
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,579
To explore all possible plans,

33
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,914
I need to be doing this from the very beginning.

34
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:48,410
And this is really how search works.

35
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,504
I have my initial state,

36
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:52,759
my start state and I apply all possible actions.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,500
In this case, one that moves left from the start,

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,750
one that moves right, one that moves up one that moves down.

39
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,394
I have four partial plans.

40
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:02,524
I pick one, I expand it,

41
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:04,305
and repeat the process.

42
00:02:04,305 --> 00:02:07,100
In this case, I get two new partial plans because

43
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,870
moving to the right is infeasible and to the left is where I came from.

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,844
Oh, that's one other wrinkle we have to think about.

45
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:17,810
Notice that if I have a partial path from the start moving right one state,

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,900
a perfectly reasonable expansion of that partial path is to then move left.

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,129
The plan would be move right,

48
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,159
then move left, taking you back to the start. That's a dumb plan.

49
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,400
And in fact, any plan that returns to a previously visited state is a bad plan.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,390
If every time we find a path to a state we added to a visited list we

51
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,974
can avoid creating new partial plans that are simply different routes to the same state.

52
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:45,919
Ultimately, I'm generating a list of partial plans that

53
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,000
don't revisit previous locations and don't run into obstacles.
