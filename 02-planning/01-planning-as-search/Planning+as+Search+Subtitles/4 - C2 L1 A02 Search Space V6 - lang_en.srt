1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,362
Before your flying car can embark on a mission to pick up or drop off passengers,

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:05,842
it needs to have a plan.

3
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:10,110
A plan is really a series of actions that your vehicle must take in order to safely

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,502
and efficiently move from some initial location to some goal location.

5
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:18,595
Or, more generally, to transform the initial state into the goal state.

6
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's consider a case where your flying car is at

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,295
the start location and you'd like to find a path to

8
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:25,530
a goal location and there are obstacles and

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,180
other things like no fly zones that you need to avoid along the way.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,740
One way to think of a path from start to goal would be as

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,090
a continuous curve through their free space between the obstacles.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,670
If you think about the infinitely many decisions the vehicle would need to

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,028
make along a flight path to follow any continuous curve to the goal,

14
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:48,070
the number of possible different action plans becomes infinitely large very quickly.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,315
When it comes to solving the planning problem,

16
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:54,855
you will often be faced with constraints in terms of time and computational resources,

17
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,080
such that the real goal is not to find the perfect solution,

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,935
but rather to come up with a reasonable solution in a reasonable amount of time.

19
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:06,900
This is why your choice of representation of the problem, or in other words,

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,235
choosing the right search space is key to solving the problem as efficiently as possible.

21
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:16,025
So let's talk more about just what goes into choosing a representation.

22
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:20,250
Since reasoning about all the possible continuous curves from

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,965
start to goal would be super complicated, unnecessarily complicated,

24
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:28,335
we need a way to recast the problem and the natural way to do this,

25
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,095
as you would with most any computational problem,

26
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:35,631
is to break the continuous universe up into a finite set of discrete states.

27
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,748
Rather than describing our vehicle's path as a smooth curve,

28
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,790
we'll describe it as a series of states

29
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,800
the vehicle must pass through to get from start to goal.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,810
Sometimes this is just a regular grid.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,790
Sometimes there are more exotic ways to define

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,595
the states unevenly across the state space.

33
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:52,710
The definition of states only gets us

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,795
part of the way toward a representation of the problem.

35
00:01:55,795 --> 00:02:00,665
We must also define actions which describe how the vehicle moves from state to state.

36
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,370
We'll see shortly that the choice of

37
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,670
state space and action space are really closely connected.

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,050
And to each type of action,

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,270
we must assign a cost which describes

40
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,990
how desirable or easy actions are relative to one another.

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,860
In summary, to represent your planning problem and define your search space,

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,460
you must have the following.

43
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,175
First, a set of all possible states in which a vehicle might find itself in the world.

44
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:26,180
Next, you need a start state and a goal state.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,080
You also need to know the set of actions that

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
allow the vehicle to move from one state to the next.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,705
And finally, you need to assign a cost to each possible action.

48
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:39,000
And there you have it, a representation of your planning problem and your search space.
