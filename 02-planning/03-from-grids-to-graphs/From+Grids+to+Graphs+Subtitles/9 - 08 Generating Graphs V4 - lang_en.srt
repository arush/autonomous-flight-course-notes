00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
One of the most well-known techniques for extracting a graph that is

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,035
kind of like a roadmap through an environment is what's known as the Voronoi diagram.

3
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:09,600
In its most basic form,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,070
the Voronoi diagram is a graph that breaks up a space into regions around a set of

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,290
seed points so that all the points in

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,530
a given region are closer to the same seed point than any other seed.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,125
That might seem pretty esoteric,

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,770
but let's imagine that we have a set of points that represent the location of obstacles.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,250
The Voronoi diagram then partitions the space into regions or

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,710
Voronoi cells where all the locations within

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,605
a given cell are closest to exactly one seed or one obstacle.

12
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:36,900
In other words, in this case,

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,820
where each seed point represents an obstacle,

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,310
then the Voronoi cell around each obstacle would contain

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,835
all locations that are closest to it. Let's draw this out once.

16
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:47,400
If these points represent my obstacles,

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,040
then I partition the space to look like this.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,550
All locations in this region here are closest to this obstacle.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,910
Similarly, all locations in this region here are closest to this obstacle.

20
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,235
The useful thing for us is actually the boundaries of the Voronoi cells.

21
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:05,385
The boundaries constitute lines that are equidistant from a pair of obstacles.

22
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:09,030
You can imagine using the Voronoi graph for planning where

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,825
the cell boundaries constitute edges in the graph that you can travel along.

24
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,390
And where these edges meet are the nodes

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,210
or waypoints that the vehicle could be traveling to.

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,290
And you could now perform search through this Voronoi graph in order to find

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,060
a collision-free path from some start location to a goal location.

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,730
What's really compelling about Voronoi graphs for things like

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,580
flying cars is that these edges represent,

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,349
in some sense, the safest path,

31
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,875
the one that is maximally far from obstacles.

32
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,890
But, one of the challenges of using Voronoi graphs

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,995
in the real world is that we don't have point obstacles.

34
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,085
We have polygons or polyhedra.

35
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:50,580
And so, the exact construction of a Voronoi graph around obstacles is non-trivial.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,235
Although the Voronoi diagram is easy to understand but hard to compute,

37
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,690
it's a specific form of a more general idea called the medial axis,

38
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,210
which is actually easier for us to compute given

39
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,260
the kinds of maps that we typically have for navigation.

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,630
The medial axis method uses the same intuition that a good graph for

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,030
navigation is one where the middle of the quarter

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,280
between obstacles is a good place to put edges.

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,510
With the medial axis transform,

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,005
you'll get something that looks basically like a Voronoi graph and

45
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:23,040
then naturally encodes safety in the construction of the graph.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,420
Here's a scenario where I have an environment including some obstacles.

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,240
And I'll start again with a grid-based discretization that

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,235
encodes each cell as being feasible or infeasible.

49
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:36,450
The way the medial access transform works is that you

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,365
start in the free space adjacent to obstacles and

51
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:42,060
iteratively step away from the obstacles until you

52
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,855
find cells that are equidistant from two different obstacles.

53
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,790
Once you have explored the entire grid,

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,545
you've identified all cells that lie along the medial axis between obstacles.

55
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55,920
Then, using present hand or another tracing method,

56
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,110
you can condense the list of cells representing

57
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,600
the medial axis into a graph of waypoints and edges.

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,380
Both the Voronoi graph and the medial access

59
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,520
transform our classic algorithms with a wide range of applications.

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
In the next set of exercises,

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,000
you'll get a chance to construct Voronoi graphs and perform a medial axis transform.
