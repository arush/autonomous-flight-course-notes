1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
So, the world is a continuous space.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,870
There's infinitely many places where a drone could be.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:11,020
And to make this computation interactable what we've done is we've

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,780
chop the world into little kind of blocks called a grid.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,790
And then we believe that inside the grid,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,965
the detail doesn't matter, and the we have finally many of these boxes.

7
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:26,020
Problem with that is for a three dimensional space as big as your city,

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,940
you have an awfully many grid blocks to represent.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,445
And that means a lot of storage and lot of computation.

10
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:38,120
Now, people discritize the space in different ways.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,840
Grid is just one is a uniform discritization,

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,630
but sometimes it makes sense to discritize in different means.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,860
For example, you might talk about intersections and road segments.

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,810
Those are typically thought as a graph.

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,960
A graph is a discritize of space with discrete notes that correspond,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,775
for example, to intersections and discrete arcs in between.

17
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,900
And you might say, "That's crazy for the skyward."

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,750
If you fly a viewer plane today in

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,650
the United States or anywhere in the world you'll find that the FAA,

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,370
the Federal Aviation Authority or whoever it

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,910
is has already chopped your sky into a graph.

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,330
There is Jet ways and Victor Vaisse and via points and

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,090
view hours that define an invisible graph in

24
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,200
our sky and on in which each commercial plane flies.
