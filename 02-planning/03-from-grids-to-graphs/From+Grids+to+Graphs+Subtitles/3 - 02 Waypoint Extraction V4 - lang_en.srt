00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,895
Using the techniques presented in previous lessons,

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:04,965
we saw that in a grid world like this,

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,735
place an obstacle right here,

4
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,853
you can find a plan that takes the vehicle,

5
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:13,780
for instance, up and over a sequence of cells and then down.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,940
Now, let's think about what this plan actually means.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,465
If you send this plan,

8
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:20,824
the sequence of grid cells to the autopilot,

9
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:23,105
what you're really asking the vehicle to do

10
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:26,530
this to travel through a sequence of short goals.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,550
So, you're telling the autopilot to go from

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,933
the start location up to some intermediate goal and then stop.

13
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:36,560
The vehicle asked to turn and it goes to the next intermediate goal and stops again,

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,620
and it goes to the next cell and stops and then over and stop and then over and stop and

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,085
then turn again and go down and then finally arrive at the final goal.

16
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:46,930
What a cumbersome plan.

17
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,830
Now, the reason that the autopilot is going to

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,005
stop in each grid cell is because remember,

19
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,105
the autopilot is just the lizard brain of the vehicle.

20
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:57,470
What's really happening is that the flight computer is sending

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,330
the autopilot the next goal or waypoint one location at a time.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,170
What we really want the vehicle to do in this case is to go up,

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,575
then turn and travel a long distance to the next goal,

24
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,960
and then turn and then go down.

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,845
We don't really want so much a sequence of grid cells for the vehicle to follow.

26
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:19,685
What we really want is a sequence of waypoints for the vehicle to travel between,

27
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:21,860
rather than all of these grid cells.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,545
We'd rather tell the vehicle to travel to one, two,

29
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:28,190
three waypoints and the autopilot will have

30
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,050
a lot easier time following this plan of

31
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,310
just a few waypoints than the original series of grid cells.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,000
The question that arises then is

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,975
how do I take that sequence of grid cells and turn it into a sequence of waypoints?

34
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,585
There's more than one way to go about this,

35
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,270
but next we'll look at a simple test you can use to

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,285
remove intermediate grid cells that lie along a line

37
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:49,610
and find a set of waypoints that approximates

38
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,000
the original plan and still keeps the vehicle safe and collision free.
