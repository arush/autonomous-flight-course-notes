1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
You've now got a bunch more tools in your kit for

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,880
planning but when it comes to executing a plan,

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,940
one issue that we've ignored so far is how to execute the plan

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,435
smoothly without actually stopping at each waypoint.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:16,320
At this point, your planning solution looks more or less like this.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,710
You have an environment with some obstacles and a plan consisting of

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,100
a set of waypoints and just like in the very first project,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,270
you have a finite state machine that takes you from waypoint to waypoint.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,010
This is a perfectly reasonable starting point but for outdoor flight in the real-world,

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,840
your vehicle will be relying on the GPS to track its position in the geodetic frame.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,545
There are a lot of ways in which this position estimate can be imprecise.

12
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:44,475
The quality of the GPS estimate can be affected by a lot of factors,

13
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,260
such as the quality of electronics,

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,740
the local environment, even changes in the atmosphere.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,440
As a result, most hobbyists GPS receivers

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,358
are really only accurate to a dozen meters or so,

17
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:58,084
and the errors in the GPS can change over time.

18
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,450
To your autopilot, GPS errors

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,240
are going to make it look like the waypoints are actually moving.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,661
To deal with this issue,

21
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,740
you'll generally have your autopilot setup to get as close

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,295
as possible to the commanded waypoint within a certain radius.

23
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:13,296
For the mavlink autopilot,

24
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:16,995
this is known as the acceptance radius and is given in meters.

25
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,825
As a natural consequence,

26
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,110
if your acceptance radius is on the same order or smaller,

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,860
then the typical GPS errors then as you move from waypoint to waypoint,

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,200
the vehicle can spend a lot of time chasing

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,725
a waypoint that seems to be jumping around and changing location.

30
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,310
In order to have better control over what it actually means to

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,925
arrive at a waypoint and handle noise in your position estimates,

32
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,475
you can introduce something called a deadband,

33
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,000
which is a region of input values.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,230
In this case, GPS measurements of the vehicles

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,710
position where the control system will take no action.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,930
For example, you can think of the acceptance radius around each waypoint as a deadband.

37
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,065
Once the vehicle is inside the acceptance radius,

38
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:02,235
it will take no further control action to try to move closer to the waypoint.

39
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:05,025
Once your vehicle reaches a deadband, for example,

40
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,680
you can explicitly tell the autopilot to stop

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,890
trying to arrive at that waypoint and move on to the next one.

42
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,050
In many cases, you won't want

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,995
the same size acceptance radius or deadband for all waypoints.

44
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:21,120
For instance, you might want to make intermediate waypoints

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,350
have wider deadbands where you move onto the next waypoint sooner,

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,695
than when you're trying to stop precisely at the goal waypoint.

47
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,950
You could even make your deadbands be a function of velocity.

48
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,270
If you're moving fast, expand the deadbands and only enforce

49
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,618
greater position accuracy when you're moving slowly or attempting to stop.

50
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:45,000
You can think about ways in which you might modify your state machine to

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,350
ensure the right logic of a deadband around each waypoint.

52
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,734
In the next exercise,

53
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:55,190
you'll get a chance to play with different deadband logic in your project code
