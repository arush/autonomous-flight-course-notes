00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,375
In the previous lesson, we saw how to take a set of obstacles,

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,240
and render them into a discrete grid with each cell

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,880
marked as feasible or infeasible based on the location of obstacles.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,110
And that labelled grid then became your state space for the planning process.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,090
You've seen that you can use an algorithm like A* to find

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,990
a minimum cost sequence or grid cells that

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,710
represents the path that you want your vehicle to follow.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,650
Turns out however, that representing a plan is a sequence of

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,390
discrete grid cells isn't really the best plan for a vehicle to follow.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,225
Fact, given your autopilot a list of all the grid cells in a path,

11
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,720
it's a bit like someone giving you directions to walk to

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,820
the local supermarket by saying something like, "Open the door,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,100
step out of the house by putting your left foot forward,

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,910
and do the same with your right foot,

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,360
then again with your left foot,

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,145
and again with your right."

17
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,245
Rather than just saying, "Head down to the corner.

18
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:53,155
Make a left, and go up half a block."

19
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:57,660
In this lesson, the first thing we're going to look at is how to convert your list of

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,830
grid cells into a better plan that represents what you actually want the vehicle to do.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,250
After that, we'll look at new ways to discretize

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,410
your world that don't rely on a grid representation.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,675
And you'll see that how you choose to represent obstacles and

24
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:16,425
freespace really has an impact on your ability to find not just collision free plans,

25
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,000
but optimal plans. Let's get started.
