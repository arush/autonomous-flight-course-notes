1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,054
One method you can employ is to take your original plan of a list of grid cells,

2
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:07,740
and extract as way points the beginning and end

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,765
state of any sequence of states that lie along a straight line.

4
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:14,720
The sequence of states like this are said to be collinear.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,280
Notice that these states right here collinear.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,625
Which if'd like to do, is put a way point at the beginning of that sequence of states,

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,745
and a way point at the end of that sequence.

8
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,970
And the way to do that is take all the states in your plan,

9
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,559
identify each subsequence of collinear states,

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,229
and keep just the beginning and end point of each subsequence as way points.

11
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,234
Let's take a closer look at this.

12
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:40,715
Here I have three points p1, p2, p3.

13
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,525
If these three points are collinear,

14
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:46,909
then the area of the triangle defined by these three points is zero.

15
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,875
In this case, my triangle has non-zero area.

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,939
On the other hand, if I have three points that are collinear like these ones here,

17
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,684
then this triangle has zero area and there's a nice trick from

18
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:01,664
linear algebra to determine whether the area of a triangle defined by three points is,

19
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:03,950
in fact, equal to zero.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,510
The way to perform this trick is to take these three points,

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,780
and put them into a matrix.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,799
So, let's say that each one of these is x1, y1,

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,230
z1, x2, y2, z2,

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,665
and x3, y3, z3.

25
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,855
Now, if the determinant of that matrix is equal to zero,

26
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,875
the area of the triangle is zero,

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,245
and these three points are collinear.

28
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,665
Another way to look at this is that the rank of this matrix is less than three,

29
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,535
which for linear algebra people makes sense.

30
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,599
Now, that was in three dimensions,

31
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,604
but if you're just working in two dimensions as I've drawn here,

32
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:36,795
you can just set that z coordinate to one,

33
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:38,510
and apply the same test.

34
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,079
We can write x1, y1,1,

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,959
x2, y2, 1, x3, y3,

36
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,359
1, and again, the determinant of this matrix

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,135
is equal to zero when these three points are collinear.

38
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,725
And when you work it out,

39
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:54,729
the simplified form to evaluate this determinant is going to be equal to x1 times

40
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,865
y2 minus y3 plus x2 times y3 minus y1 plus x3 times y1 minus y2.

41
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,314
And if that quantity is equal to zero,

42
00:02:03,314 --> 00:02:05,384
then these three points are collinear.

43
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:08,700
You can step through your list of grid cells and evaluate all triplet's of

44
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,949
adjacent points and every time you find

45
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,264
a sequence of three points that collinear according to this equation,

46
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:17,114
you can simply delete the middle point from the path.

47
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:21,659
And this particular equation for 2D is very efficient to evaluate.

48
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,275
So, building this step into your planning process will look like this.

49
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:28,344
First, discretize your world into a grid.

50
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:32,639
Second, use A* to get a sequence of cells from the start state to the goal state.

51
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,739
Third, test for collinearlity already to see

52
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,004
if you can delete some cells from the initial path.

53
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,530
And as easy as that,

54
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,060
you're left with a reduced path of way points.

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,810
Remember our trajectory from the previous example that looks like this.

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,340
Our collinearlity test will eliminate that point,

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,050
that point, and that point.

58
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,685
Leaving this way point,

59
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,920
this way point, and this way point.

60
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,149
This is a simple method for finding a set of way points that in this case,

61
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,745
exactly approximates your original plan,

62
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:02,830
but doesn't have the autopilot making the vehicle stop and

63
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,000
start unnecessarily as it travels through the grid.
