1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
In this lesson, you've expanded your set of tools for discretizing your environment.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,150
You've seen how a path that you planned through a grid can be simplified

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,845
or condensed into a series of waypoints by finding connections through free space.

4
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:16,065
You also saw that if you like,

5
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:19,740
you can toss out the grid-based discretization entirely and directly

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,420
construct a graph of nodes connected by edges that represent your search space.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,040
There are tradeoffs, however,

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,470
between using grids versus graphs when it comes to solving the planning problem,

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,090
and you need to ensure whatever representation you choose,

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:37,675
that it satisfies your requirements for completeness and optimality.

11
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,745
In real-world robotics applications,

12
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:44,185
there's typically no one right answer for how to represent your planning problem.

13
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:45,565
And in many cases,

14
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:49,465
using some combination of grid and graph-based representations

15
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:53,710
as you did with the medial axis transform can give you the best of both worlds.

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,410
So far, we've been working in two dimensions,

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,935
but all of these techniques are equally valid in three dimensions.

18
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,890
So that's where we're headed next.
