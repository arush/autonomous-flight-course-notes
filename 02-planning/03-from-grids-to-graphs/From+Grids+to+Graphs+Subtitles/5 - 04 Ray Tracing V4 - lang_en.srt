1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
The collinearity test is one way to identify which cells don't actually need to be

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,360
used in order to express the path, but it doesn't necessarily lead to the optimal result.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,325
You saw that one representation of this simple path is to go to here, and here,

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:16,590
and then down to the goal, but you could imagine

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,175
an even more efficient approximation of this path.

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:20,550
Which is to go from start,

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,080
cut across through here,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,703
and then cut down to the goal.

9
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:26,950
Now, a collinearity test is not going to tell you that you don't actually

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,670
need to go up to this intermediate state here but can cut right across.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,920
But clearly this path here is still very much in

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,445
free space and this path here is also in free space.

13
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:38,830
In order to find line segments that approximate

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,435
our original sequence of grid cells and ensure that the path is still in free space,

15
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:45,550
we'll use a technique called ray tracing.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,050
For this first segment, what we want to do is to determine what grid cells lie on

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,850
the line from the start state up to here and are they in free space or collision.

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,970
Given two points, for instance P1 and P2,

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,720
which cells lie along that line?

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,388
Well, if P1 is at location X1,Y1 and P2 is at X2, Y2,

21
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,800
then any point on that line,

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,116
y of x is going to be given by Y2 minus Y1 over X2 minus X1 times X plus Y1.

23
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,010
Just the equation of the line.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,990
You can then iterate X from X1 to X2 and evaluate each pair X,

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,980
Y of X for collision.

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,315
If you'd get from X1 to X2 and every value X,

27
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:29,072
Y of X is not in collision,

28
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,330
not inside an obstacle,

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,050
then you know that the entire line must lie entirely in free space.

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,762
You can start with X1,

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,970
then X1 plus one, X1 plus two,

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,950
all the way to X2 and you can look at

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,548
the corresponding Y-values and check to see if each cell is in collision.

34
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:48,680
And in this case, what you'd see is that when you get to X1 plus two Y of X1 plus two,

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,840
right here, you can see you're in collision.

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,650
Your ray tracing method will tell you that this line is in collision and you cannot

37
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,150
in fact fly in a straight line from this point here to this point here.
