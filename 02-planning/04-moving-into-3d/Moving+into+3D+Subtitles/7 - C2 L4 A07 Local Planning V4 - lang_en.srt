1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
The probabilistic road map is a great way to find feasible plans through

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,690
a full 3D environment without incurring

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,350
the costs of building and maintaining a dense 3D grid map.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,965
But it's not a silver bullet especially over long time scales.

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,774
Why is that?

6
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,500
Well, let's think about the two sources of computational complexity.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,335
The first is the cost of building the model.

8
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:25,640
And the second, is the cost of planning through the model.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,570
I can build the probabilistic road map by sampling

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,840
points and building a graph around the obstacles, that's one phase.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,788
If I know the environment perfectly ahead of time,

12
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,105
and the positions of obstacles don't change,

13
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,835
then I only need to build that graph once.

14
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:43,312
In the real world, that turns out to be a terrible assumption.

15
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,100
Obstacles appear and disappear,

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,425
and you need to be ready for the unexpected.

17
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:51,205
But, assuming that the environment is relatively fixed,

18
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:54,865
you're only going to run the probabilistic road map algorithm once.

19
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,355
Then, to find an actual plan,

20
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,010
you run search on the graph using something like A* to

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,760
find a plan from the start to the goal.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,295
In reality, you're likely to run A* multiple times.

23
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,635
This is what's known as multiple query planning,

24
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,810
the opposite being single query planning.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,280
And what that means for a fixed graph that you built using the probabilistic road map,

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,408
is that your computational cost will be dominated by the search.

27
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:21,160
From your implementation of A*,

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,725
you'll recall that the computational cost of the search is of order b to the d,

29
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:29,950
where for our road map the branching term b is the maximum number of edges out of a node.

30
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,455
And d, is the number of edges you have to travel to get from the start to the goal,

31
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,550
which is the length of the plan.

32
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,650
The best that you can do in terms of reducing

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,550
computational complexity given a fixed graph,

34
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,288
is reducing the branching factor and the total length of the plan.

35
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:47,815
You can try to find edges there as long as possible,

36
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,672
but if the environment doesn't cooperate,

37
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,800
then you're still going to pay in terms of computational complexity.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,972
What else might you do?

39
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:59,080
Well, a common idea in planning and control is

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,280
to recognize the planning the entire trajectory from start to goal,

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,240
considering all state variables and

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,245
all possible features of the environment is often the wrong thing to do.

43
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:12,582
For instance, planning the entire trajectory in 3D, maybe overkill,

44
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:16,885
especially if they're obstacles that are going to pop up along the way.

45
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:22,345
A better strategy is to plan an approximate root in 2D using a coarse grid to graph,

46
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:24,291
and then as the vehicle travels,

47
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,770
keep improving that plan after some distance or

48
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,995
horizon using the global plan as a heuristic.

49
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,268
Given some obstacles like this,

50
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:35,320
you might plan a course trajectory to travel around the obstacles,

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
and then in a local region around the vehicle,

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,660
you could do higher resolution obstacle avoidance,

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,763
and that local plan might be a 3D plan.

54
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,348
As your vehicle moves,

55
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:47,380
you move the local region around with you,

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,370
doing the 3D planning in that small footprint.

57
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,230
The fact that the region in which you're constructing

58
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,345
the local plan moves as the vehicle is moving

59
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:59,935
is why this two level approach is often referred to as receding horizon planning.

60
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:04,870
And, there's a very similar concept in control called receding horizon control.

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,900
Next, we'll look at an example of how this works.
