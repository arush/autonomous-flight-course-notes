1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
In this lesson, you crossed

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,780
the threshold into the third dimension of the planning problem.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,520
We looked at the fact that while 3D grids are highly expressive geometry,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,115
they can be prohibitively expensive to store in memory.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:14,415
You saw that if you're willing to give up a bit of that expressiveness,

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,470
you can get a huge advantage by going to

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,930
a two and a half D representation of the problem.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,805
We looked at how you can use

9
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:24,705
random sampling to generate a representation of your state space,

10
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:27,345
and how, through connecting those random states with edges,

11
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:31,155
you can form a probabilistic road map representation of your planning problem.

12
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,560
With the tools in this lesson combined with previous lessons,

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,520
you've actually got what you need to implement a receding horizon planning solution,

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,324
where you create a course plan or heuristic over your entire space in 2D

15
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:46,950
then continuously re-plan over a local volume as you execute your flight plan.

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,670
And with that, you're ready to complete the 3D motion planning project.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,160
You can actually skip the next lesson as it is not

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,770
required to implement a passing solution of the project.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,115
That said, if you want to take your planning project above and beyond,

20
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,600
then consider including some of

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,110
the advanced methods in the next lesson in your implementation.
