1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,589
Just as obstacles can pop up or disappear,

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:05,865
small inaccuracies in the position estimate

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:08,609
are another source of uncertainty for flying car.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,299
A real flying car is always going to encounter small disturbances and things

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,679
like how its rotors move or small disturbances from the environment like wind.

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,725
This means that no matter how good the autopilot is,

7
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,060
a real vehicle will never track a path perfectly.

8
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,989
Dealing with small disturbances can

9
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:27,639
often be taken care of with a minor course correction.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,774
But in the case of large disturbances,

11
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:32,960
your planner may have to take more significant action.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,700
For example, suppose that your vehicle is hit by

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,785
a gust of wind or a steady prevailing wind and blown

14
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,819
far enough off course that there is now a building or

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,344
some other obstacle in the way on the path to the next waypoint,

16
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:50,429
your planner will need to re-plan and that isn't always an instantaneous process.

17
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,500
So before re-planning, your state machine

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,884
may need to stop the vehicle and go into a hover,

19
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:56,817
or for a fixed-wing vehicle,

20
00:00:56,817 --> 00:01:00,030
do some other safety maneuver like go into a loiter pattern.

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,630
The main point is that when a real flying vehicle is enroute to a waypoint,

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,665
it needs to be constantly checking if

23
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,758
the flight path is still feasible from its current position.

24
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:10,984
In the next lesson,

25
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:13,125
you'll get a chance to see the effect of wind

26
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,000
on your vehicle and detect the need to re-plan.
