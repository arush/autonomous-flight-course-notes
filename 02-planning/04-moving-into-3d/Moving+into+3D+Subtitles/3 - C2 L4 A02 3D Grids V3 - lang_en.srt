00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Let's start by looking at the most basic kind of 3D representation,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,940
which is a grid with one cell per discrete X, Y, Z coordinate.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,645
So here, I've got my X Y and Z coordinate axes,

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,075
and I'll have cells in a 3D grid like this.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:16,710
And just like in the 2D case,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,455
I'll label each cell as feasible or infeasible,

7
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,020
free space or obstacle.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,290
3D cells are often called voxels,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,955
which derives from pixels.

10
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:27,160
Pixel is short for picture element,

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,230
and voxel is short for volume element.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,960
So, a voxel is the 3D version of a pixel.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,455
In this sense, a 3D grid map is often called the voxel map.

14
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:39,340
You can build a voxel map from obstacle polyhedra using ray

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,510
tracing like the Bresenham line drawing algorithm just as you did in 2D.

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,060
Once you have a voxel map with obstacles labeled,

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,605
then you can use it for planning.

18
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:51,715
And so, having extended your statespace into this 3D grid,

19
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:54,250
you can use your planning algorithms like A* to

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,505
expand partial paths toward a goal just as in 2D.

21
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:00,850
Solving the planning problem into 3D grid does not require

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,945
much of anything new in terms of changes to your code that you used for the 2D case,

23
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,465
but the problem with this kind of representation

24
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:11,140
is these kinds of grids are considerably memory-intensive to store,

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,550
especially if you're trying to map a large volume at high resolution.

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,095
In this next exercise,

27
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:21,660
you'll get a chance to play with solving the planning problem using a 3D grid.
