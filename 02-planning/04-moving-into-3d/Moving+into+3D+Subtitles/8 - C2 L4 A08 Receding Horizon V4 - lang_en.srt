00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,194
Let's look at an example of receding horizon planning.

2
00:00:03,194 --> 00:00:07,529
The basic idea is that you construct an initial plan like this,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,505
using some approximate model around the course features in the environment.

4
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:14,339
In this case, an approximate model might be to take

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,309
your 2D grid model with relatively large grid cells,

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,929
rather than a full 3D model,

7
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,839
and use that 2D model to construct a rough plan.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,160
Then, you construct a local plan using a more detailed model considering,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,565
for example, the full 3D polyhedra of the obstacles.

10
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:33,570
But you only compute the local plan out to some relatively nearby horizon.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,240
The goal is not going to be inside that distance.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,304
So, for the local model,

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,960
you can set the goal as the nearest state on the global plan,

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,704
outside the horizon, given by the global planner.

15
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:44,879
The local planner will plant inside

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,490
that horizon to the nearest state in the global planner.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,640
The vehicle starts executing the local plan but the key

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,539
is that as the vehicle moves the states inside the horizon change.

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,949
As you see here,

20
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,800
the horizon is changing as the vehicle moves and

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,027
the vehicle keeps re-planning out to the new horizon.

22
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:04,200
An even better idea to modify this is,

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,650
instead of having the local plan be the next state in the global plan,

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,425
you could start instead by using breadth-first search

25
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:13,905
backward from the goal to every state in the 2D global model.

26
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:16,814
By running breadth-first search backwards from the goal,

27
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:20,745
you're computing the cost of the shortest path from each state to the goal.

28
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:25,590
In this way, you can label each state in the global model with the cost of the goal.

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,560
And now, the local planner can then try and find

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,210
the minimum cost path inside

31
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,629
the local model to the minimum cost state in the global plan.

32
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,399
What's nice is that you can keep

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,594
this global cost field fixed and then, as the vehicle moves,

34
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:43,780
it can keep picking new global states to fly to as the horizon moves outward.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,465
Now, a couple of questions might be on your mind.

36
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:49,790
First, how do you pick the horizon for the local planner?

37
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,730
This is entirely a function of how fast the vehicle

38
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,640
is moving and how quickly the planner can re-plan,

39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,715
which will be a function of how fast your flight computer is.

40
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,885
There isn't really a recipe or an algorithm for picking the horizon.

41
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:06,350
You just have to know how far out you can plan given

42
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:10,584
the constraints of how fast you're flying and your computational constraints.

43
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:11,795
In the next exercise,

44
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:16,204
you'll get a chance to implement a receding horizon planner and figure out what

45
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:21,080
works well in terms of resolution for both the local and global planner,

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
as well as horizon scale.
