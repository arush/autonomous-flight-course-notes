1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Up to this point, you've looked at a couple of

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,055
different ways to solve the planning problem for flying cars.

3
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:07,395
And you've been working in two-dimensions.

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,185
We talked about 2D grids, and 2D graphs.

5
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:12,795
But flying cars exist in three-dimensions.

6
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,510
Now, we're going to take a look at how to actually solve

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,950
the planning problem for a three-dimensional vehicle in a three-dimensional world.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,845
Remember, the things you need in order to solve the planning problem are the state-space,

9
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,605
an action space, a cost function,

10
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:30,420
and a start and goal state.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,010
To get at the state-space,

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,845
you need to represent not just the geometry of the world in 3D,

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,235
but the configuration space.

14
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,045
This is not always an easy task.

15
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:40,100
Depending on the representation you choose,

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,870
some tasks may become easier,

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,505
and other tasks, harder.

18
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:46,055
The computer graphics industry, in particular,

19
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,610
has looked at a lot of the problems with representing objects in three-dimensions.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,185
And you may have seen several of these issues previously if you ever worked in graphics.

21
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,375
For the purposes of motion planning,

22
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,060
what we care about in terms of a 3D representation

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,880
of the world is the same thing we cared about in 2D.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,940
Namely, whether or not a particular location in

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,545
the configuration space is free or occupied by an obstacle.

26
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,000
Previously, we talked about how your configuration space is

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,065
a function not only of the position of the vehicle but orientation as well.

28
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:17,640
For the purposes of flight,

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,425
and particularly for quadrotors,

30
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:23,415
you can usually get away with using a simple 3D configuration space,

31
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:26,565
and ignore the effects of orientation or attitude.

32
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:31,245
However, the truth is that in moving from two-dimensions to three-dimensions,

33
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:32,835
planning gets more expensive.

34
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:36,750
You'll have choices to make in terms of what you want to optimize for,

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,115
which for the most part,

36
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,935
we'll come down to trade-offs in computational complexity,

37
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,350
and the completeness of your planning representation.
