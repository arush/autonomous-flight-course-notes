00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
There are a couple of more key ideas that we need to

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,869
consider about the vehicle representation in order to get to planning.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,390
You now know that you can represent the location of

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,015
your vehicle as a reference point in some coordinate frame.

5
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:17,640
For the most part, we'll be considering the local ECEF frame for planning and you

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,824
can represent your vehicles orientation in that local ECEF frame as a reference vector.

7
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,259
So, you have your vehicle in a local ECEF coordinate frame,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,820
it's got some reference location point, it's got some orientation.

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,365
And next, you can think about actual motion of the vehicle

10
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:38,010
as basically just changes to the reference point in your coordinate system.

11
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,719
So for instance, if the vehicle is at

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,789
some location 'x' sub 'b' and is going to move to some new location,

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,789
let's call it 'x' sub 'b' prime then we can think of the new location of

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,924
the vehicle is equal to the previous location plus this transformation vector.

15
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:54,809
If you want your vehicle to not only translate to a new location,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,870
but also to rotate to some new orientation then

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,244
you'll construct a corresponding quaternion 'q' sub theta

18
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,890
and you can now think of your new orientation as equal to

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,385
'q' sub theta times the original orientation times 'q' sub theta prime.

20
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,094
And so it's as simple as that.

21
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,489
Every time your vehicle goes through

22
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:14,834
a transformation of position and orientation during planning,

23
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,009
you're just applying a translation to

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,844
the reference points and a rotation to the reference orientation.

25
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:25,000
You can sequence these changes together over time to create a plan.
