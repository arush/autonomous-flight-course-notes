00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
In 1843 in Dublin,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,100
William Rowan Hamilton had an epiphany so

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,835
profound he felt compelled to scroll it into the Broome bridge.

4
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:14,495
I squared equals J squared equals K squared equals IJK equals minus one.

5
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:16,477
So what the heck does that even mean?

6
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:19,845
Well, for starters we're talking about quaternions here and I,

7
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,080
J and K are all imaginary numbers,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,835
which means that they do strange things like squared to negative one.

9
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:30,420
A single quaternion basically accomplishes the same thing mathematically as a series

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,190
of rotation matrix multiplications but in a much more compact form.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,815
I can represent a quaternion as a scalar quantity A and then three numbers B C and D,

12
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:45,220
which when those three are taken together are the vector component of the quaternion.

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,255
You can think of the vector component as representing the magnitude in each of the I,

14
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:51,140
J and K directions.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,975
So this is just mathematical notation and is not very intuitive,

16
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:58,260
but this compact representation is equivalent to a composition of

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,380
three rotation matrices and can be used just

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,823
as well to describe the orientation of your vehicle.

19
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:07,380
And when it comes to changes in orientation,

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,375
the interesting thing about quaternions is that if I have a unit quaternion,

21
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,440
which is to say the square root of the sum of

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,785
the squares of the scalar and the vector component is equal to one,

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:21,600
then my quaternion Q corresponds to a unique rotation in

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
three dimensional space and that means I can use

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,074
quaternions to represent changes in the orientation of my vehicle as well.

26
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:34,230
To perform a rotation, you'll need a unit quaternion and it's inverse.

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,443
The inverse of a unit quaternion is pretty simple.

28
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:40,890
Just write the same thing with minus signs where the plus signs were.

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,780
And now for example,

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,600
if I have some point on the body frame of the vehicle and I

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,020
pre and post multiply by the quaternion and its inverse,

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,600
then I get out some new point which is a result of

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,489
rotating by whatever rotation is encoded in that quaternion.

34
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,610
I can also multiply quaternions together to compose multiple rotations,

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,840
and I can convert from Euler angles to quaternions and back again.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,245
For computation, the quaternion representation

37
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:11,220
is better than both the Euler angles and rotation matrices in

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
that it avoids some of the problems associated with

39
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,830
these other representations such as substantial over parameterization and gimbal lock.

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,690
Still, it's often useful to convert back to

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,495
Euler angles to be able to present a more human readable version of what's going on.

42
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:29,715
So here are the quaternion representations of roll,

43
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:32,460
pitch and yaw, and these equations

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,705
here show how to convert from quaternions back to Euler angles.

45
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:41,610
Similarly, you can recover rotation matrices from A,

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,585
B and C like this.

47
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,620
For the most part, this will all be going on under the hood in

48
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,725
your code and you don't need to worry too much about these equations,

49
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:52,980
but it's just worth keeping in mind the conversion between

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,000
quaternions and the more familiar Euler angles is pretty easy.
