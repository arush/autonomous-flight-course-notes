1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,005
One last coordinate frame that we're going to keep track of is the body frame.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,575
The origin of the body frame is going to be some point on the vehicle.

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,955
Could be for example,

4
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:11,940
the center of mass, or it could be some other location.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,040
All of the other points in the body frame are defined relative to that origin.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,710
If the vehicle moves,

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,870
the body frame moves with it.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,550
There are two main reasons we need a body frame.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,840
One is that the body frame is a really useful and convenient way of keeping track of

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,385
the relative distances between different elements of the vehicle like the sensors.

11
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:32,280
So, I might have a camera on the front of the vehicle,

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,020
I might have an IMU at the tail,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,735
I might have air sensors on the wings and so on.

14
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:39,540
Knowing where all of these sensors are relative to one

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,270
another in the body frame is very important

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,625
for fusing all the sensor measurements together

17
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,045
into a consistent estimate of where the vehicle is.

18
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:52,020
The second reason the body frame is important is that this is often

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,360
the best coordinate frame for representing

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,675
control inputs such as velocities and accelerations.

21
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:00,510
For example, for a fixed-wing vehicle,

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,870
it's easiest to think of the throttle just changing the magnitude of

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,440
the thrust vector that is fixed along the x axis in the body frame.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,220
As the vehicle is moving and rotating that thrust vector changes,

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,165
which way it points in the external world,

26
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:15,710
but it's going to stay constant in the body frame.

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,280
It's a lot harder to think of the throttle as a three-dimensional control input.
