00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
In this lesson, I've covered the basics of

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,330
vehicle representation which is a key concept in robotics applications of all kinds.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,474
But in particular, for flying cars,

4
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:10,289
where you'll need to plan a path from

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,375
one place to another while avoiding obstacles along the way.

6
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,480
We started out by looking at

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,625
the coordinate systems that you'll be dealing with in this program.

8
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,579
These include the geodetic frame,

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,139
which is a spherical latitude and

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,399
longitude frame covering the entire surface of the earth.

11
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,684
Then, your local Earth-Center Earth-Fixed or ECEF frame,

12
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:31,919
which is a more convenient Cartesian frame for

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,289
representimg motion within your local environment.

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,149
And finally, the body frame,

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,365
which allows you to define where things are

16
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:41,640
with respect to one another on the body of your vehicle.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,700
Next, we looked at vehicle orientations and how you

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,015
can describe changes in orientation using Euler angles,

19
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,664
and rotation matrices, or quaternions.

20
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:54,450
In this program, you'll be converting back and forth between Euler angles and

21
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,859
quaternions to take advantage of the mathematical simplicity of quaternions,

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,575
and the intuitive nature of Euler angles.

23
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,260
With position and orientation defined,

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,660
we looked at how you can describe the motion of

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,409
your vehicle using transformations of position and orientation.

26
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,799
And finally, we explored how

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,009
the physical shape of your vehicle can be taken into consideration to

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,920
define a configuration space which is the parameter space

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,000
that allows you to treat your vehicle as a simple point.
