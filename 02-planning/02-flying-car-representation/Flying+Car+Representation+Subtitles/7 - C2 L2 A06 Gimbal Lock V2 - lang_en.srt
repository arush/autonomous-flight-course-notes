1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
As I said before, Euler angles are intuitive,

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,129
but they suffer from a problem known as gimbal lock.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,919
So, first off, what the heck is a gimbal anyway?

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,679
Well, gimbal is just a support with a pivot point

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,849
that allows an object to be rotated about one axis.

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,710
To allow more degrees of freedom, we can add more gimbals.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,510
To be able to rotate about three axes and simulate the behavior of Euler angle rotations,

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,150
we'll need three gimbals, like this.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,399
So, for Euler rotations,

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,033
you can imagine your vehicle attached to these gimbals,

11
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:31,589
and you send it commands to roll,

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,570
pitch, and yaw about the axes in the gimbals.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,420
What you'll notice very quickly in this configuration is that order matters.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,255
To demonstrate gimbal lock in this configuration,

15
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,760
I can see that if I start a series of

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,954
rotations by first pitching the vehicle up to 90 degrees,

17
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:51,780
then what will happen is that the red and blue gimbals will line up.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,776
Suddenly roll and yaw actually have the same effect.

19
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:58,290
What that means is that the vehicle can no longer yaw.

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,045
Or rather, it will be as if a yaw maneuver actually affects the roll of the vehicle.

21
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,894
This was a real problem for the Apollo astronauts.

22
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:10,465
They were using a mechanical set of gimbals to compute the attitude of their vehicle,

23
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:14,405
and they needed the flight computer to warn them if they were close to gimbal lock,

24
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:18,859
and they would have to be careful to steer the ship away from falling into gimbal lock,

25
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,825
if they wanted to know which way was up.

26
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:23,570
This was so annoying that Michael Collins asked

27
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:26,299
mission control for an extra gimbal for Christmas.

28
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,629
A redundant fourth gimbal makes gimbal lock go away.

29
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:32,344
Why didn't the Apollo units have a fourth gimbal?

30
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:35,569
Well, it seems that at MIT we didn't think

31
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,049
the weight and cost is worth it. Sorry about that Mike.

32
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,109
So, does this mean the vehicle can't physically yaw?

33
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,579
Well, if it were bolted to

34
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,549
a gimbal apparatus like this that's exactly what it would mean.

35
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,179
But of course our vehicle is not bolted down and is free to physically yaw,

36
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,287
but by describing orientation through the use of Euler angles,

37
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:57,080
we've effectively bolted it down with mathematics

38
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,295
because the order of rotations can cause exactly the same effect.

39
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:05,390
So, gimbal lock is both a mathematical property of using Euler angles to

40
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,421
represent the vehicle's attitude and is a physical property of real gimbals.

41
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,633
If you have a device that stabilized using three separate mechanical gimbals,

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,429
the ordering of how they are arranged matters,

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,740
just like the order in which you apply Euler rotations matters.
