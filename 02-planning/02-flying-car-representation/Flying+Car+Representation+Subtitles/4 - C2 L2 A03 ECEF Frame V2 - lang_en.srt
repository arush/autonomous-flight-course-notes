1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
From geodetic coordinates, the first thing you usually want to

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,300
do is convert to a linearized Cartesian coordinate frame,

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,640
the so-called Earth-centered Earth-fixed or ECEF frame.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,380
The key idea with the ECEF frame is that every point in

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,060
space is represented as x, y, and z.

6
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,500
What is really most useful is a coordinate system that

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,855
actually has its origin somewhere on the surface of the earth.

8
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:25,769
That could be your takeoff point

9
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,030
or maybe it's home-based or some other convenient location.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,605
In this frame, the z coordinate is the height above the surface of the earth

11
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:37,324
while x and y basically tell you how far you are laterally from the origin of the frame.

12
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:40,470
And with that, you have a local ECEF frame.

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,390
So, next comes the choice of how to represent

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,649
this frame with respect to the geodetic frame.

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,198
The x and y axes now define a plane that's

16
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:49,829
tangent to the surface of the earth, and in principle,

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,795
I could choose to have those axes point at any direction where

18
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,359
the most common representation using aeronautics

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,829
is having x point north, then y point east.

20
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,640
Wait a second, that's not east, that's east.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,750
That means, z has to point down.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,060
It might seem counter-intuitive to have z point

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,995
down instead of up to indicate altitude above the earth,

24
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,355
but in this case, that would leave you with

25
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:15,125
a left-handed coordinate system which is not standard for aeronautics.

26
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,480
So instead, we let z be positive downward and we have

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,890
the so-called North East Down or NED coordinate frame.

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,849
This is the most common local frame used in aeronautics and is what

29
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,069
we'll be using as our local ECEF frame throughout this program.
