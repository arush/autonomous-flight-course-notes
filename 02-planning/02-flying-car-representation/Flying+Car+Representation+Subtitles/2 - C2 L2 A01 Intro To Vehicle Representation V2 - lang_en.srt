1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Up to this point, you've been considering how you can find

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,379
a path from a start state to a goal state by connecting cells in a grid.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,984
In the real world, however,

4
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:11,369
you need to take into account the fact that your vehicle has

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,535
physical size that occupies space in the world,

6
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,280
and not only that, it has an orientation which for

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,475
some kinds of vehicles can limit how and where it can move.

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:24,145
A big part of solving the planning problem is finding a way to represent the vehicle.

9
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:26,414
And for different kinds of representations,

10
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:29,894
particular algorithms can operate more or less efficiently.

11
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:31,980
So in this lesson, we'll take a look at how to

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,765
represent your vehicle's position and orientation within the world.

13
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,244
And then, how to incorporate

14
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:41,509
that information into your search space for solving the planning problem.

15
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,034
We'll start out by investigating

16
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,179
three different coordinate frames that come in

17
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,850
handy for representing your vehicle's position,

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,844
namely: the geodetic or global frame,

19
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:53,100
your local Cartesian coordinate frame,

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,240
and the body frame which is a coordinate frame attached to the vehicle itself.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,579
After that, I'll show you how you can express

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,070
your vehicle's orientation using Euler angles and

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,530
rotation matrices and how life gets

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,650
so much simpler when you switch to using quaternions. What are those?

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,030
We'll find out. We'll combine these representations of position and orientation to

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,129
describe the motion through the physical world

27
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,189
as transformations of position and orientation.

28
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,599
And finally, we'll explore

29
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,140
the so-called configuration space of your planning problem which is

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,000
the parameter space where you incorporate

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,250
your vehicle's physical size and shape into your description of the environment.
