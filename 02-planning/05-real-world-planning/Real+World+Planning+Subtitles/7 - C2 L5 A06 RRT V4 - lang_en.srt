1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
You now have a steer function that,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,865
given some start state X1 and some destination state X2,

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:10,890
allows you to randomly guess a set of controls that will try to make progress towards X2.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,010
I use the word "try" loosely. How do we use this?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,470
Well, you're trying to answer the question of,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,787
"Does there exist a set of controls that will get us from X1 to X2?"

7
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:23,790
And the steer function puts you at some point, for example, here.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,655
If you're actually randomly sampling controls,

9
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,550
most of the time you'll end up with controls that will

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,820
not give you an edge from X1 all the way to X2,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,500
but you will find an edge from X1 to some sample state that I'll call "X_new",

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,110
and you determine X_new by using

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,895
the simulate function to propagate the controls U-s and U-phi from X1.

14
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:46,845
To build a graph with this method,

15
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,455
rather than worrying about actually arriving at X2,

16
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,140
let's just throw away X2 and keep X_new.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,060
Now you actually have a pair of states with an edge

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,295
between them and are labeled with the control.

19
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,755
So great, you have an edge in your graph.

20
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,950
The way that the probabilistic road map algorithm worked was by

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,630
sampling all the states first and then drawing edges between them.

22
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,380
In this case, you're not actually going to be able

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,050
to build a graph in two separate steps like that,

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,135
so let's do this iteratively.

25
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,870
Let's combine both the state sampling and edge creation.

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,990
The algorithm looks like this: sample state,

27
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,945
try to generate controls that'll steer towards that state,

28
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:27,010
simulate your X_new, and then add X_new to the graph along with

29
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,600
U_s and U_phi and discard the original sample state, then iterate.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,625
This algorithm is what's known as the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree or RRT.

31
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,020
The reason it's a tree,

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,235
as opposed to a graph,

33
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:42,335
is that it's not always the case that these edges are reversible.

34
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,150
If you're at X1 and you can get to X_new,

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,800
that does not necessarily mean that you know how to get from X_new back to X1.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,145
Differential constraints may mean that those edges are not reversible.

37
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:54,735
It is very much a tree.

38
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,220
In the next exercise,

39
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,500
you'll get a chance to implement RRT and

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,880
generate a tree representation of your state-space.
