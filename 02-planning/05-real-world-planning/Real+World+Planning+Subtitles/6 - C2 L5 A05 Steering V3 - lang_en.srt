1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
In the last exercise,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,990
you wrote a method called simulate that allows you to

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,750
predict where the vehicle will end up given an initial state,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,780
and some controls, steering angle, and velocity.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,560
The next thing to do is to actually incorporate this into your planner.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,684
As you moved from 2D to 3D,

7
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:18,300
you saw that a discrete grid would be unwieldy,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,815
and we switched to graph-based methods,

9
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,480
like the probabilistic roadmap.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,080
The way the probabilistic roadmap worked is that we assumed that we

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,440
could get from any state to any other state along a straight line,

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,390
so long as obstacles weren't in the way.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,660
That is, given sample states X1 and X2,

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,050
we can draw an edge, and decide that the edge

15
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,990
is valid if no kinematic constraint is violated.

16
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,815
In doing this, we ignored orientation, velocity,

17
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:47,090
inertia, and even what the controls needed to be in order to make that edge happen.

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,480
Now, because we have more complicated differential constraints,

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,000
to see if you can add an edge between two states,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,690
you need to know what controls can get you from X1 to X2.

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,370
Or in other words, you need to know

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,385
what setting of the velocity and steering angle you need.

23
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:05,195
So, let's say that the curve trajectory you want to follow looks like this.

24
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:09,155
Not only do you need to know what controls will get you from X1 to X2,

25
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:11,090
but also whether any obstacles,

26
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,270
any kinematic constraints are violated along that trajectory.

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,220
How do we solve for the controls?

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,450
Given a pair of states X1 and X2,

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,765
solving for the control that gives the solution to get from X1 to X2 is, in general,

30
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:26,630
a two-point boundary value problem in differential equations,

31
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,795
and can be very difficult to solve for a lot of real systems.

32
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:31,715
There may even be multiple solutions,

33
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,635
some of which are collision-free, and some of which are not.

34
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,600
Instead of trying to solve the boundary value problem,

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,730
which can be as hard as the original planning problem itself,

36
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,670
let's do what seems like a crazy thing and just guess at a set of controls,

37
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,875
and see how close we get to X2.

38
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,020
We'll call this process of guessing

39
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,845
a control sequence to get from X1 to X2, the steer function.

40
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:56,305
Given X1 and some X2,

41
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,340
we'll guess U_s and U_phi and see where we end up.
