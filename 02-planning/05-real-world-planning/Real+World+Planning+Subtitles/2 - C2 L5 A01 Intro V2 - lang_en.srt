1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,991
With the exercises you've completed in the previous lessons,

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:06,580
you're ready to tackle the final 3D motion planning project.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,179
If you're ready to dive in and complete the project,

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,469
just go ahead and skip to

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,855
the next lesson where you will find instructions for getting started.

6
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:15,660
In this lesson, I'll present

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,949
some more advanced methods to take your project implementation above and beyond.

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,759
But feel free to skip ahead or just come back to it later when you have some time.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,350
Okay, you're still here I see.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,965
Well then, let's get right into it.

11
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,734
In most of the lessons so far,

12
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,854
we have assumed an idealized version of reality in physics.

13
00:00:34,854 --> 00:00:37,759
We have assumed the vehicle knows exactly where it is in the world.

14
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,460
We have assumed the vehicle knows exactly where

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,844
every obstacle is in the world ahead of time,

16
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:44,019
and we've assumed that the vehicle was able

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,685
to follow a trajectory through the world perfectly.

18
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,030
We've also assumed that as long as a path exists through

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,750
free space that we can command the vehicle to follow that path.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,340
In the real world,

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,230
all of these assumptions break down.

22
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:00,284
The information available in a map ahead of time is usually imperfect.

23
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:03,129
And we've talked a little bit about what to do when obstacles

24
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,415
appear or are missing from the map at the time of flight.

25
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,845
Sensor measurements like GPS have inherent errors.

26
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:11,679
We talked about what to do when

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
environmental conditions can make following a trajectory challenging.

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,929
A final issue is that all vehicles have constraints on

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,105
how they can move and you need to include those constraints in your planning solution.

30
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,560
So, in this lesson, we'll touch on a couple

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,600
more of these elements of real world planning so that

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:32,799
you have the tools you need to take

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,000
your project implementation to the next level and deploy it on real hardware.
