1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,004
What you've seen over the course of the last few lessons is that really,

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,484
there could be as many as three stages of planning.

3
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,820
There is a proximate global planning that takes into account

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,690
the full length scale of where the vehicle needs to go in order to complete its mission.

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,869
This stage will include some approximate model of the obstacles and

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,030
free space which could be a 2D or 3D or even two and a half D map.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,210
A good global planning strategy might feature a global plan in 2D,

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,620
but along the way,

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,325
you can have a receding horizon 3D planner or second planner.

10
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:31,559
With this second planner, you're attempting to follow

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,530
the rough outline of the global plan but at the same time,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,039
avoiding local obstacles and responding to the unexpected.

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,964
Beyond that, you can implement the third potential field planner for

14
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:43,740
local obstacle void at high speed

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,250
including known obstacles and things that are not already in the map.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,619
By combining all three of these planning layers,

17
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,804
you'll have the ability to implement different kinds of planners all working together

18
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:58,500
with each one offering different trade-offs in terms of planning efficiency,

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,149
response time, complexity, and how much information is available ahead of

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,010
time which will give your vehicle maximum flexibility and maximum reliability.
