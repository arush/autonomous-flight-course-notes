1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
The last thing you need to do is put

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,345
kinematic constraints and obstacles back into the planning problem.

3
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:07,250
In the last few exercises,

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,720
you've just been worrying about looking for control sequences that

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,148
satisfy the differential constraints of the Duban's car model,

6
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:16,560
but you also need to look for control sequences that don't hit things.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,710
You can incorporate obstacles in two places.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,640
Given a graph or tree of possible curves that your vehicle might be following,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,785
first, when you sample new state X2,

10
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:27,900
you can check for kinematic feasibility.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,600
And then, more importantly, secondly,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,345
when you're attempting to steer to this point using the steer function,

13
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:36,720
you can actually modify the simulate function to check at

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,725
each step along the way whether you're in collision on your way to X_new.

15
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:45,210
What you're really doing inside simulate is walking along this curve here.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,270
And just as in the problematic road map,

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,300
you can test for kinematic feasibility at each step along its edge.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
What if you hit something? Do you

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,720
throw the edge away if you're going to have a collision?

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,635
No. In fact, if there is an obstacle here that you would hit,

21
00:00:58,635 --> 00:01:01,815
then you simply stop and put X_new right there,

22
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:05,850
and you start propagating all the way horizonty and keep X_new,

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,710
the last state that was feasible.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,967
And with that, you've extended your RT implementation,

25
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,455
where you started with randomly sampled states,

26
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:18,090
growing the graph, trying to steer towards the samples without collision.

27
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,260
Now it's your turn to implement.
