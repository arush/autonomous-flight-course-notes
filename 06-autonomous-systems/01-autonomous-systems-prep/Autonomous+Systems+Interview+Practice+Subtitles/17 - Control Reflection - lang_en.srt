00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
Halyon had a fairly good answer for his PID controller.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,960
He went through each step of proportional,

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,949
integral, and derivative, and explained each of these well,

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:12,119
and how they relate to the overall PID controller equation,

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,479
which is what gets output for steering angle,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,605
for instance, or for a robotic arm.

7
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,265
One of the things I would say that he could do better was the first time he went through.

8
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,355
He mainly did things in pseudocode.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:27,140
I prompted him a little bit to say what would you do if this within C++,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,920
and he did a good job to add

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,300
his type declarations like floats as well as initializing things to zero,

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,709
if they needed to be, and adding semicolons.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,520
Other than that though, I thought he gave a great answer.
