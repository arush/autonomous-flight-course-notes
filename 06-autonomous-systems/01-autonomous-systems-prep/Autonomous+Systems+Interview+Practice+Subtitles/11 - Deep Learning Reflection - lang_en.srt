00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
Aaron did a great job in is deep learning interview.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,349
He went through and clearly stated

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,070
what all made up semantic segmentation and how it works.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,544
He did a very good job in going through the technical nature

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,804
of a neural network and explaining the encoder to decoder network,

6
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:16,920
and especially when he started getting into

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,550
his loss functions which are extremely important for semantic segmentation.

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,160
It was clear that he knew what he was talking about.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,300
One of the things I would probably ask Aaron to do, otherwise,

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,080
is maybe to even code a little bit of his neural network perhaps in TensorFlow or Keras,

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,835
just to show his knowledge of those deep learning libraries.

12
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:36,350
Other than that, though, I really liked Aaron's answer.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,960
He showed his technical knowledge really well,
