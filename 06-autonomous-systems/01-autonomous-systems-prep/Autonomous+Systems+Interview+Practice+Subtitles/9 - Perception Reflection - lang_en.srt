1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Vienna very quickly identified that

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,714
a Kalman filter would be a great application for sensor fusion.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,910
That's definitely something that I would expect us to use in

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,509
her actual job role so it's great

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,419
that that was the first thing that popped into her mind,

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,914
and she explained it well.

7
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,469
Going forward from there, it was okay that she didn't know

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:18,739
exactly what she would do with different refresh rates.

9
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,125
It's not something, unless you've done a lot of hands on work,

10
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,274
that you necessarily have the experience with.

11
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:25,829
It's good that she didn't necessarily just try to come up

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,609
with a completely random answer that didn't really apply here.

13
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,609
So, it was great that when we got into the camera data,

14
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,644
she definitely identified that camera data would be important for our application,

15
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,955
that having more data of different types

16
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,799
only can become better for your perception system,

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,954
and it's important to know that that should be something we should include.

18
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,979
After that, again, we got into some of

19
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,409
the hands-on type of thing whether she'd worked in this yet,

20
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:49,839
but a lot of people don't have it.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,300
It was something that we considered nice to have beforehand,

22
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,994
and it's not something that we're going to

23
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:57,239
necessarily count off for if they don't have that yet.
