00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,214
Nice work watching and reflecting on each of the interviews.

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:05,355
We hope you gained some valuable insight

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,975
into how to approach some of these types of questions.

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,080
Below this video, we've included

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,880
some additional resources for you to use in

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,304
preparing for your autonomous systems interview.

7
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,980
Some are focused on building up your skills,

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,635
some typical programming problems you'll solve.

9
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,270
We suggest to do them in

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,745
the programming language you'll need for the jobs you want to apply for.

11
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:27,144
Again, for autonomous systems roles,

12
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,524
this typically means C++.

13
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:33,229
We also have linked some resources to help you build up your knowledge of

14
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:37,509
data structures and algorithms including runtime and complexity as well.

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:42,958
Again, make sure you refresh yourself on any topics listed in job responsibilities,

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,930
minimum requirements, or if you've put something on your resume.

17
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,560
For instance, if the job description mentioned

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,230
systems architect and real time operating systems,

19
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,314
you should make sure you feel comfortable in those areas.

20
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:59,239
Of course, don't forget to research the company itself.
