1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,040
After watching and reflecting on the example interviews, it'll be your turn.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,134
You'll get a chance to choose questions from an area of your interest,

3
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,879
like deep learning engineer or controls engineer,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,320
and answer a few questions for that role.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,960
Along with the more role-specific questions,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,950
you'll also be asked to respond to a question about a recent project you've worked on,

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,274
to help show your expertise and passion in that area.

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,199
This can be a deceptively important question.

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,929
Can you articulate why you chose this project?

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,140
What steps along with missteps you took along the way,

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,049
why the end result was interesting,

12
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,339
and potentially, even what you'd do to further improve it?

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,310
Now, before we get started on the interviews.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,650
Let's talk through a few more important areas to

15
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,759
consider for interviews in autonomous systems.
