00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,384
Well, it's great to have you out here today, Harry Young.

2
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:05,689
I'm really excited to interview you for our control engineer position.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,320
What I'd like to start off with is just a question in controls actually. Are you ready?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,185
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,429
Okay, great. So, my first question for you is just

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,855
to explain the different components of PID control.

7
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:23,130
Okay, sure. So, PID controller: the P stands for Proportional,

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,789
I for integral and D for derivative and

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,535
those controllers is one of the most used controller in industry.

10
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:36,100
Yeah, great. So, if you are going to code a PID controller, how would you do it?

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,914
Okay, sure. Let me just go ahead and write those on the whiteboard.

12
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,725
Great.

13
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,600
So, as we just discussed,

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,439
PID we need the three controller variables,

15
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,265
the first one would be the kp for proportional

16
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:55,945
and ki for integral and the kd for derivative.

17
00:00:55,945 --> 00:01:00,630
Essentially, what you're going to receive is our error,

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,330
the value of our current error.

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,575
We are trying to gain a control output.

20
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,670
I have it here.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,424
So, all control loop,

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:19,844
essentially we are calculate the control value using the error in our PID variables.

23
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:24,174
Because we are using integral and derivative of parameters,

24
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:29,334
so we need also two other variables to calculate those states.

25
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:33,324
There's first of all I will say is the error of

26
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:38,770
integral and also to calculate derivative we need the previous error,

27
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:41,369
our codes error underscore free.

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,575
So in a control loop,

29
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:46,454
basically we are going to first,

30
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:50,754
let's do an update of our integral error.

31
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:56,359
So, that will be errors underscore i plus equal to

32
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:03,605
our error in this loop and then we're going to go ahead and calculate the value here.

33
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:10,365
So that will be four equals to first, the proportional one,

34
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,855
our kp times our error,

35
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:19,639
then our integral as it was already updated here.

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,324
So, I'll go ahead and use it directly.

37
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:29,009
Error underscore i and the last one would be the derivative,

38
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,609
so kd times the derivative of which

39
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,100
essentially is our current error minus our previous error.

40
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,359
One of the things to know is that after this loop,

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,085
we kind of need to update our previous error here.

42
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,860
So, our current error become our previous error in the next loop.

43
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,700
So, that's our error here and that will be my control loop of a PID controller.

44
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:03,984
Okay, great.

45
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,880
So, in going through this,

46
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,134
if you're going to do it, say,

47
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,479
in C plus plus,

48
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,164
how do you think you might need to initialize

49
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,804
variables including some of the types that you might use?

50
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:21,430
Yeah. So, I'll say that would really depends on what our error and control variable is.

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,314
But suppose we will be using mostly float for

52
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:31,650
error and come full output variable and since they're essentially the same,

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,254
we'll also have float here as our error.

54
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:38,805
Since the initial state,

55
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:43,849
our integral error should be zero since there's no error before and also

56
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:49,875
our previous error should be ideally zeros to calculate the derivative later.

57
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,500
Okay, great.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,360
So, if you have a PID controller in there,

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
it does seem like it works in a lot of situations,

60
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,409
are there any situations you can think of where it wouldn't work so well?

61
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,569
Yeah, I guess PID is most widely used controller.

62
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:12,560
One thing I will say about some case that PID is not appropriate,

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
maybe for like non-linear systems since

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,959
our control output may not be able to influence the system's output in a linear fashion.

65
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,629
So, the PID controller will be struggling with different areas of that control output.

66
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:38,375
Also, another aspect I will say it will be our simple system.

67
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,865
You probably don't even need to use a full PID controller,

68
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,465
sometimes maybe a proportional controller is fine.

69
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:48,709
Great, okay. That's everything I had for this area anyway,

70
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,014
we can move on to next topic now.

71
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:50,474
Cool.

72
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,080
All right.
