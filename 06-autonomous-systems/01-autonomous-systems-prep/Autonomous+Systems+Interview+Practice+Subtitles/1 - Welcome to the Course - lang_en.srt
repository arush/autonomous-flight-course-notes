00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,484
Hello. Welcome to our autonomous systems interview course.

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:07,679
I'm Michael, the learning technologist from our self-driving car team here at Udacity.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm a graduate of the School of autonomous systems myself,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,170
as I completed the self-driving car engineer in

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,125
every program prior to joining Udacity and now,

6
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:19,445
I'm responsible for leading constant updates we make to the program.

7
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:23,929
Today, we're here to help you interview for a job and all things autonomous,

8
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,390
whether it be robotics,

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,175
self-driving cars, flying cars and more.

10
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:31,245
First, we're going to show you some example interviews.

11
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,750
You'll watch to see how the interviewees responds to each question,

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,250
how they worked through the problem at hand and how

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,994
they show their interviewer their thought process.

14
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,169
After each video, you'll have the chance to

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,204
reflect on what you thought the interviewee did well,

16
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,869
what they didn't do well and then hear from

17
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:51,754
the interviewer themselves on what they thought of the approach and answer.

18
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:56,995
A big item to note here is the focus is not just on solving the problem quickly,

19
00:00:56,994 --> 00:01:01,280
the interviewer wants to see your thought process behind tackling the problem.
