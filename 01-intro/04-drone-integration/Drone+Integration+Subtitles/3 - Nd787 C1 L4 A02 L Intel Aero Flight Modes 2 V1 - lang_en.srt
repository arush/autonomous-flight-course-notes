1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,812
Can I go ahead and fly?

2
00:00:01,812 --> 00:00:04,070
Still one more thing.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,530
We've talked that there are different kinds of control modes.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,929
There are different ways that you can fly or

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,765
different ways that your input can affect the vehicle.

6
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:15,044
One of the most basic ways is manual,

7
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:19,259
which means every piece of information I put in is going directly,

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,105
more or less, to the motors.

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,810
It means that it's not going to try and hold the position.

10
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,834
It's not going to try and hold an altitude.

11
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,690
It'll drift, it'll bounce around.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,790
So that's kind of the lowest level of control.

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,207
But the attitude loop is all the way running.

14
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:32,601
Correct, yes.

15
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,914
So the vehicles, you don't have to worry about keeping the vehicle level.

16
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:35,390
Correct.

17
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,487
That part will always work.

18
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,994
Yes. And then, there are a couple other modes that

19
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:45,059
I've configured the arrow to use that I recommend.

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,830
One is called altitude control.

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,585
So, what that does is it takes

22
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:50,957
you having to worry about the throttle out of the equation.

23
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,549
It holds a fixed altitude.

24
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:57,797
So while you're flying you can then focus on just where its horizontal position.

25
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,825
Note, that it still will drift with the wind.

26
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,750
It's not trying to hold this specific position.

27
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,914
So on a windy day, you've got to be careful,

28
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,914
or else it will get away from you.

29
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,720
The next one is position control.

30
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,469
And what now, we're doing is adding

31
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:14,370
just one more control loop that the autopilot is taking care of.

32
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,870
It's going to try and hold the position.

33
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,150
So now my commands are really just moving

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,385
around this fixed point that it's going to hold.

35
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:23,025
So on a windy day, should stay fixed.

36
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,805
The last mode, this can be of interest to something called off-board control,

37
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,800
and that's you as a pilot,

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,024
releasing control to the computer,

39
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,939
to our backyard flyers script.

40
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,689
So it's always called off-board mode, I know that.

41
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,536
It's kind of a misnomer, cause its really it's on-board control, isn't it?

42
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:41,700
That's well, I mean, it's off-board of the main auto pilot board,

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,049
it's a secondary computer.

44
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,036
Off-board this, on-board there.

45
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:45,849
Yeah. Correct.

46
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,206
Very good.

47
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:50,159
And so one thing that we can do is we've got

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,444
some of these switches are set up to change between those modes.

49
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:57,864
So we can look on the ground station to make sure that as I flip the switches,

50
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:00,149
it's correctly cycling between

51
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,000
the desired modes and rejecting the modes that it can't go into yet.
