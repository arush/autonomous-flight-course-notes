1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
All right, what's next?

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,099
We just need to plug this guy in and then.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:06,209
Let's take the props off now.

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,120
Yup. When you plug it in,

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,599
you always want to make sure this cable can't be hit by a propeller.

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,459
So, for example, the way we have it plugged in

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,375
now is probably not the way you'll want to plug it in when we fly.

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,250
I find it's actually pretty useful.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,704
You can run this connector through one of the legs.

10
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:31,129
So, you can bring it around and run the battery connected through one of the legs.

11
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,185
And you can see now that the cable is,

12
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:36,760
no matter how much it moves,

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,174
its not going to hit the propeller.

14
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,744
So, always before we turn on the drone,

15
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:44,349
we want to be able to turn on our remote.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,079
So, we'll turn that on first. Big power switch.

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:47,991
All right.

18
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:53,739
Throttle should always be down before you turn on the drone.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,020
Part of the reason we're doing this is to make

20
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,780
sure that we are going to be the ones in control of our drone.

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,600
The last thing you want is to turn this on and

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,754
some other guys remote to pair with your drone and all of a sudden they have control.

23
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,664
So, that's on, we'll turn our arrow on,

24
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,750
and give it a minute to boot up.

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,180
How do we know when it's done booting?

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,330
We'll actually see a Wi-Fi network

27
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,959
that's generated by this vehicle that we'll be able to connect to.

28
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,029
For other systems usually,

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,549
it's flashing light, an auditory signal.

30
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,129
Most have some way to communicate from the drone to the ground. Connecting.

31
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,349
Shall we do a motor spin test?

32
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,099
Yes, we can.

33
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,063
All right.

34
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:40,294
Here we go. And if you want to throttle up,

35
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:43,716
you'll be able to hear the motors speed up.

36
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,324
This is why you don't put the props on indoors,

37
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:50,554
because if I armed the motors accidentally,

38
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:52,799
and then I hit the throttle up, the vehicle will take off.

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,959
Yup.
