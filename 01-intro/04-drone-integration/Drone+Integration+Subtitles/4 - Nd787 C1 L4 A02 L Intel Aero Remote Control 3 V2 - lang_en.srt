1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
So, some of the basic controls you need to know just

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,615
to get started is arming and disarming.

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:06,990
So, that's going to be getting the motors ready to take

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,518
commands and releasing the motors from that state.

5
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:14,070
So, down into the right is going to arm the motors which gets them to start spinning.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,350
And when you want to kind of turn everything off,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,810
it's going be down and to the left.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,644
And down to the right again to arm.

9
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:26,300
And I have throttle up and make the vehicle take off.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,574
I can yaw and fly at high speed into the wall to the right,

11
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:34,399
fly at high speed into the wall to the left.

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,449
The only other set of switches on here that's going to be important to know,

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,350
are going to be the way we have it configured it's going to be these two switches.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,539
Will the students running the same script have

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,030
the same configuration or do they have to know how to configure it?

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,120
One of the screencasts is to walk into the configuration,

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,179
so it's going to be through queue ground control.

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,789
We're actually able to change the configurations on the autopilot and one of them

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,744
is to configure the switches to be able to change different control modes.

20
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,699
So one of the things you're going to want to do is go through

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,344
that configuration process before you take your vehicle outside.

22
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:07,939
Very much so. So, we've got two sets of

23
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,439
switches are going to help us get

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,719
through all the different states that we're going to want.

25
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,609
When this switch is all the way towards you,

26
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,450
when both this switches are all the way towards you.

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,730
This one and this one.

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,530
Correct.

29
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,625
That's going to be manual control.

30
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,484
So, that's going to be the most basic amount of input that you can get.

31
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,176
This top switch in middle position,

32
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:31,424
is what we are going to call our main assisted modes.

33
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,534
So, middle position bottom that's going to be altitude mode.

34
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:36,009
So, the vehicle is going to try and hold

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,140
its altitude which means you don't have to worry as much about the throttling input.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,820
But it will drift left and right. Correct.

37
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,284
Middle position is position control.

38
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:48,500
And that means it's going to be working to hold its position.

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,137
So, when you release your hand from all the commands,

40
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:54,055
it should hold where it is and not drift with any wind.

41
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,208
And then finally, when it's time to turn that script on

42
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,900
all the way up, puts it into off-board control.

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,145
So, that releases control from you the pilot, to the computer.

44
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:11,316
So, a process that I might go through is a fully manual mode.

45
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:16,849
Arming the vehicle, put it in an assist mode.

46
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,313
And now, I'm in off-board mode,

47
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,219
puts all the control, on-board the vehicle, and then we start our script.

48
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:23,210
Correct.

49
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,640
Very good.

50
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,919
Normally, you want to bring it back to manual before you disarm.

51
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,379
All right. Good point.

52
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,924
So, everything that we have here, this remote,

53
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:36,570
this vehicle, it's specifically for this this drone.

54
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,430
There are many different ones out there that you can get.

55
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,885
Most remotes actually do look more or less the same.

56
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:44,549
You're always have these two joysticks and some collection of switches.

57
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,860
So for your vehicle,

58
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,925
if you have your own custom build at home,

59
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,778
your switches may be configured differently,

60
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:55,060
and maybe you prefer to have right handed versus a left handed system.

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,735
But what's nice is with this autopilot,

62
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:00,530
if this doesn't really work for you in that screencast,

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,334
we'll show you how to configure it.

64
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,979
So, if you want to change up the switches,

65
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,030
you definitely can to something that's a little bit more your style.

66
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,030
Great.
