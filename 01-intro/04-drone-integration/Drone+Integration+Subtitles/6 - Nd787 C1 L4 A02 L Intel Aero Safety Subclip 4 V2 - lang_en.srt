00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,075
As a pilot, even for an autonomous vehicle like this,

2
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:05,835
you want to first check the air space to make sure it's clear.

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,830
You want to know if there are other drones in the area that you

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,012
need to avoid or other aircraft of any kind.

5
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:12,449
The other thing is that, if is anybody with you on the ground,

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,829
you want to make sure they know where to be.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,545
They should never be between you and the drone.

8
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:19,410
You should always be able to see your vehicle at all times.

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,640
Ideally, there's a line on the ground that people know to stay behind.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,149
Yep, and also in addition to that line,

11
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,309
don't fly over people or over buildings,

12
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,349
and try and find open space.

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,440
Good.
