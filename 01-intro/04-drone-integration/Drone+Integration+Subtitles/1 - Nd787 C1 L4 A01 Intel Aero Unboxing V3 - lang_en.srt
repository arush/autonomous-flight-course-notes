1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Now, that you've been through the backyard Flyer Project,

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,290
you've had a chance to implement a simple planning, control strategy for your vehicle,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,970
but only in simulation.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,899
We set it up, so that you can also run it on a real vehicle.

5
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,868
And to help me get your software onto a real vehicle,

6
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:17,114
I'd like to introduce my friend, Adrien.

7
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:20,099
Adrien, you are a Ph.D. student at Stanford, right?

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,400
I am, by practice.

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,549
Yep, but you're also a drone expert.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,150
I am. Well, expert, it's a tough word to use.

11
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,670
I've been around drones for quite a while.

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,710
So since, I've been about 12, I've been flying.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,259
Initially, it was just fixed wings.

14
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,829
I used to build some of them, and then,

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,589
realized that I enjoyed flying them a lot more than building them.

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,300
And it was easier to just buy them, and then fly them.

17
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,134
And I used to do kind of tricks and acrobatics basically with fixed wings.

18
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,489
And then, five years ago,

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,140
when I started at Stanford,

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,859
I found a project that required using, kind of a quadcopter.

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,299
And I figured, well,

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,939
if I'm going to kind of do something on a quadcopter,

23
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,695
I should probably learn how to fly those.

24
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,980
So, I've been flying quads for the past, probably five years.

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,930
Do you know Adam Bry from Skydio from under the program?

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,083
I'm not familiar.

27
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,560
I think I've heard his name before but.

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,049
Yes, he's a former grad student of mine and he's background is very similar to yours.

29
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,709
He started building vehicles and he's very young,

30
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,244
and competed and then,

31
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,155
went to grad school and worked with me for a while.

32
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,329
So, Adrien, what we got here?

33
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:26,370
This is the Intel Aero.

34
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,314
It's called the Ready to Fly Drone.

35
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:31,015
So, it's about everything you need to fly, right in the box.

36
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,745
It comes all together as one piece.

37
00:01:32,745 --> 00:01:36,475
But this is just one of many different types of drones.

38
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,819
There is somewhere, kind of much more do it yourself,

39
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,914
where you buy a frame here, and an autopilot there, and you put it together.

40
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:43,925
But this is what we're going to work with today.

41
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:47,414
I should note that while we're working with this today for our script,

42
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,580
that same script is going to be able to work with any

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,579
of the PX4 family of drones, right out of the box.

44
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,435
And we're working to try and get integration to maybe some of those other platforms,

45
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:59,210
like what you see from Parrot or DJI,

46
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,864
or some other manufacturers.

47
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,664
So, this is just an option. If you happen to have a drone,

48
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,950
the software that you've written so far should work on one family of drones,

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,525
and we'll try and make it work for everybody's drones.

50
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,879
All right. Can we open it up?

51
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,930
Let's do it.

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,025
All right. Man, this thing is really sealed tight.

53
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:21,395
I wish there was some way that we could get this box cover off.

54
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:25,250
Thanks box fairy, that was awesome. All right, what do we have here?

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,312
So, we've got our instruction manuals on top.

56
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,109
Instructions?

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,600
Which you should read.

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,245
And then, we've got our drone and our remote control.

59
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:35,740
Everything we're going to need to fly it.

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,210
All right. Let's take the drone out first.

61
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,540
Put that there.

62
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,829
Do you want to grab the, and there is one extra box right there, as well.

63
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,594
Box of tricks.

64
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:47,594
All right.

65
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:50,210
So, this should look fairly similar.

66
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,969
It's got all the main components that you've already learned about.

67
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:53,129
Okay.

68
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,490
We've got our frame, that carries the four motors.

69
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,740
Here, the speed control as we talked about,

70
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,855
that control the motors, are a little bit hidden.

71
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:02,938
If we flipped them upside down, you can see them.

72
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:05,014
There's one for each motor, one in each arm.

73
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:08,639
And then, we've got this big box in the center and that's

74
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,404
actually a combination autopilot and full computer.

75
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:13,860
So, in addition to being able to have

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,410
all those functionality that you get from an autopilot,

77
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,549
keep it stable and allow you to fly,

78
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,920
we have, what they call,

79
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,664
a companion computer on-board.

80
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,129
So, that's actually running on Ubuntu,

81
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,514
and you can run quite a lot of stuff on there,

82
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,764
and that's going to be for later down the road.

83
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,189
But for this first project,

84
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,409
we're not necessarily going to be using that.

85
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,030
All right, terrific. What's that?

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,925
That's a power module.

87
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,170
So, what that's taking

88
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,854
is going to be the power from the battery and converting the voltages

89
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,819
it needs for the computer to run and for all the motors.

90
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,219
Okay.

91
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,590
And then, this big guy here is our GPS antenna.

92
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,590
Let me screw that in there.

93
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,509
And it sits on a mass,

94
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,344
nice and far from all the noise that you get,

95
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:58,530
all that kind of radio frequency interference that is generated by the motors,

96
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,537
the speed control is by the computer, that's

97
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:04,745
so we can get kind of a clean GPS signal for positioning.

98
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,545
So, we've got our vehicle.

99
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:06,786
Yeah.

100
00:04:06,786 --> 00:04:10,875
And we can't fly the vehicle without some way to give control commands.

101
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,680
And that's what our remote control is for.

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:13,820
Excellent.

103
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,055
There's a lot of switches and knobs on there,

104
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,980
but for the most part, the important ones are the joysticks.

105
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,485
Much like you would with a kind of game controller.

106
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:25,814
You've got throttle, for up down.

107
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:28,649
That's yaw to rotates our vehicle.

108
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,539
We've got roll and pitch.

109
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,138
So, that's going to be a way for us to physically,

110
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:35,279
as a pilot, input commands to the vehicle.

111
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,030
Although, with the software the students had written,

112
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:38,639
they shouldn't need to use this very much.

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,689
Correct.

114
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:40,879
Will they need it all?

115
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,949
They will need it to do some startup procedures.

116
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,762
It's always safest to be able to have a way to fall back to manual control of vehicle.

117
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:53,324
In case something goes wrong with the script or some odd behavior,

118
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,860
you want to be able to flip back and take control yourself.

119
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,879
Okay. So, we'll hold on to this.

120
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,009
And the last thing we have is propellers.

121
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,699
Comes with plenty of spares.

122
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:09,354
Not that any student has taken our Nanodegree would ever need a spare propeller.

123
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:12,379
So, we have two black and two silver. All right.

124
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,259
And you'll see, they are color coordinated,

125
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,724
and part of that,

126
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,564
so the silver ones are going to go on the white tops,

127
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,209
black ones are going to go on black tops.

128
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:20,454
And part of that is,

129
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,305
since they're rotating in different directions,

130
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,355
you want the propeller to lock into the motor

131
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:30,410
in a direction such that as the motor spinning, it won't unscrew.

132
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,920
So, that's why it keeps it easy to color coordinate.

133
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,210
So normally, we wouldn't be really putting the propellers on indoors.

134
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,444
Usually, you're going to do that outside, just before you take off.

135
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:44,894
But just to demonstrate what it looks like fully built,

136
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:48,019
here is our quad almost all ready to go.

137
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:51,000
You at least, would probably never want to have the props on,

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
when the battery is in, until you were actually ready to fly.

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,360
Yeah.

140
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,089
Safety. Speaking of which, the battery.

141
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,199
So, that is one thing that doesn't come when you purchase an Intel Aero.

142
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,185
So, you need to make sure that,

143
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:07,064
in addition to buying everything you see here,

144
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:11,574
you buy either a 3-cell or a 4-cell lithium polymer battery.

145
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,379
Do you need to buy battery for this, as well?

146
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,569
Comes with batteries.

147
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:15,949
This one comes with batteries.

148
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,279
But the vehicle itself, does not.

149
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,759
Correct.

150
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,039
All right. So, if you want to get your laptop,

151
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,359
we can order a battery from Amazon.

152
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,634
It'll be here in two business days?

153
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,319
I wonder if there's an easier way to get a battery.

154
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,224
Awesome. Thanks, battery fairy. There we go.

155
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:33,240
So, this is a 3-cell battery,

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,115
that is going to work with our quad.

157
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:37,379
When you say 3-cells,

158
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,884
there's actually a three different batteries inside there.

159
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:43,935
That's correct. And this will actually work with something also called the 4-cell.

160
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:47,610
which brings us to a conversation of what does 3-cell,

161
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,285
4-cell even mean.

162
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:51,095
So, with lithium polymer batteries,

163
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:54,365
they're a little bit different than most of the different batteries that,

164
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,470
for example what's in here.

165
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,260
Looks like four regular double A batteries.

166
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,629
And the remote control needs four batteries.

167
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,860
This thing needs basically,

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,634
the equivalent of putting three in a row or four together.

169
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,414
And what that's going to do is, just change the voltage that the battery is running at.

170
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:13,350
Motors and speed controllers are paired to work at specific voltages.

171
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,520
And so, you can get batteries in a different set of voltages.

172
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,430
Does that make it hard to charge the battery?

173
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,180
It does mean that when you charge the battery,

174
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,660
you needed to charge it for a specific voltage.

175
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,300
So, in this case, I need to charge it as a 3-cell battery.

176
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,649
If I start to charge it as a four-cell battery,

177
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,670
that's when you can start to damage the battery and can cause other problems.

178
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,444
So, battery safety is a big deal.

179
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,894
And so, you do need to have the right charger.

180
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,865
And if your battery ever becomes puffy and looks a little angry,

181
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,535
you need to dispose of it carefully.

182
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:46,465
Disposing it carefully means different things in different places,

183
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:49,679
so you should either check with your local health and safety officer,

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,365
if you're at a company, or you should consult

185
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,910
your city on how to dispose of damaged lithium polymer batteries.

186
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,965
They are very high energy density, very high power density.

187
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:03,099
They're basically, like little munitions and they will explode if you're not careful.

188
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,375
And in addition to charging at the right voltage,

189
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,855
there's this other big number that you usually see when you're buying batteries.

190
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:13,134
So, this is called a three-cell 4,000 milliamp power.

191
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:16,615
Now, at 4,000 milliamp power is capacity. It's duration.

192
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:19,535
How long will effectively we'll be able to fly,

193
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:21,515
basically it's four amp powers.

194
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,694
Bigger the number, the longer you can fly.

195
00:08:23,694 --> 00:08:25,365
But when you charge,

196
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,400
it's also going to be a function of this number,

197
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,750
in addition to that voltage.

198
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,029
So, for example, this 4,000 milliamp power battery,

199
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,845
you can charge safely at four amps.

200
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,940
Once you start to push it to five, six, seven amps,

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,810
that's when you can, again start to damage or destroy the battery.

202
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,907
You're also perfectly safe to charge it at one amp.

203
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:48,000
It'll just take four times as long to charge. Great.
