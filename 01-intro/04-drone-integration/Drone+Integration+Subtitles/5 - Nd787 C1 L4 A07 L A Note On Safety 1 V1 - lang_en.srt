1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,097
Before we do go outside,

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:05,096
in addition to all the common sense safety things we've been talking about,

3
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:07,665
there are some regulatory issues you need to be aware of.

4
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:09,435
Depending on which country you're in,

5
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,745
and even depending on which part of which country you're in,

6
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:13,231
the rules may be different.

7
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:16,769
And so, the first thing you have to do is, know before you fly.

8
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,780
In the US, it's important that you follow the part 107 rules.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,890
Which means that you,

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,510
as a pilot, especially,

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,500
if you're doing anything that is not just your personal hobbyist entertainment,

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,627
need to have an actual pilot's license for an autonomous vehicle.

13
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,230
And you can go on the FAA website,

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,709
and you take a paper test and then, you're good to go.

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,365
And if you are a hobbyist, you don't even need the part 107 license.

16
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,160
But it's really important that you actually

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,019
understand whether or not you're allowed to fly where you're planning to fly.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,450
A good guideline is,

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,248
Adrien already mentioned, don't fly over people, don't fly over buildings.

20
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,460
Another important guideline is,

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,064
don't fly near airports.

22
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,629
Again, in the US, there are restrictions on how

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,030
close you can be to different kinds of airports,

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,944
and you need to know what those are.

25
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,810
And in other countries, it may be different.

26
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,405
Other regulatory issues?

27
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:03,495
The only thing that I would add is,

28
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,370
if you're strictly doing this as a hobbyist,

29
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,192
as you pointed out, you don't need to get a specific license.

30
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:11,370
But you do need to follow a community set of guidelines if there are.

31
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,725
So you can check out,

32
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,414
there's the Academy of Model Aeronautics.

33
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:17,220
They've got a lot of rules or guidelines,

34
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,944
and then, either way,

35
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:21,245
you do need, what they call register your drone.

36
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,069
It's a fairly painless process.

37
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:25,119
You go online, you put your name,

38
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,365
what kind of vehicle it is,

39
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:30,000
and you get a registration number that should be taped somewhere on the drone.
