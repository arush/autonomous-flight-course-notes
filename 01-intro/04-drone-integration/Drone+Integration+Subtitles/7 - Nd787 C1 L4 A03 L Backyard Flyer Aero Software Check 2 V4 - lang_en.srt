00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
For those following along who have the Intel Aero.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video we will walk through a couple checks to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,330
make sure the aero software is up to date and fully ready to go.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,970
We can communicate with the Intel Aero by

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,760
connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot that it generates.

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,190
And that's going to be the way that we're going to get information

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,730
down from the aero and commands up to the aero.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,089
Using that same hotspot we can actually login to

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,765
the computer itself to make sure that the software is up to date.

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:32,329
So to do that, we're going to turn on our drone,

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:39,137
and it takes a couple minutes for it to boot up and get the computer up and running.

12
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,229
In the meantime what we're going to do is we're going to navigate

13
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,140
to our network settings to be able to

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:52,314
find and wait for the Wi-Fi hotspot generated by the Intel Aero to come online.

15
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:57,280
Here we go, so here we can look at our list of network names and

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,195
we'll see one that starts with an aero dash as the prefix,

17
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,405
for any of you who might have something that looks different,

18
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:10,344
now another option is that it might say AP or CAP dash and then long number here.

19
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:15,219
If you don't have aero dash as the prefix to the Wi-Fi hotspot it means that

20
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,650
the Intel Aero is running an outdated version of

21
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,205
the software and you'll need to go ahead and update the software.

22
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:26,679
So for updating the software the Intel has a pretty detailed Wikipedia with

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,320
tutorials on how to update different software and

24
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,709
navigate parts of the Intel Aero computer.

25
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,853
Provided that you have the correct firmware,

26
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,394
or software, we can connect to the network.

27
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:44,045
Again Intel has in their detailed documentation here,

28
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:52,129
a page all about network that reminds you of what the password is to the Wi-Fi hotspot.

29
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:56,030
So, they also list the IP address of

30
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,299
the drone so that what we're going to go ahead and connect to.

31
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,409
So we'll SSH into the drone and the only user is root,

32
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,274
so we'll SSH as root.

33
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:11,719
So we'll go ahead and connect as root to the Intel Aero.

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,074
So now we are the SSH-ed into the Intel Aero itself.

35
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:18,134
So this is the computer that runs on-board of our drone.

36
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:21,359
This computer manages that network connection to

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,590
the ground and it also manages the running of the autopilot on-board.

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,159
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to check to make sure that

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,122
we have the most up to date version of the software,

40
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:37,574
and with that Intel provides a simple script to be able to test,

41
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,500
to be able to print out the version information and that's

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,655
going to be aero-get-version.py,

43
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:50,640
which is also shown here in their tutorial.

44
00:02:50,639 --> 00:03:00,384
So now we'll run that. And we can see that we're running aero version 1.00.13.

45
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:10,557
It has the flight control firmware version is 1.6.5 which at the time of this recording,

46
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,680
this is the most up to date version of the software and this is what you will

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,330
need to be running in order for backyard flyer to work properly on the aero.

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,730
If this is not the version number,

49
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:25,899
specifically if these top portions don't match

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:34,340
with what I have on my screen here or with what Intel shows as the most recent version,

51
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,300
then please go ahead and follow this initial setup Wiki that

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,406
they have and instructions to update your software.

53
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:46,129
You'll notice this last line says flight control firmware version and that's

54
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,284
just telling us the version of the autopilot that's running currently.

55
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:53,585
And so by default it runs the PX4 autopilot,

56
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,805
and should provide a number like that.

57
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:58,610
If for whatever reason it doesn't seem to be running

58
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,745
PX4 or it seems to have a different version number,

59
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:10,930
we can update just the autopilot software itself by running this set of commands.

60
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,150
If your version information matches this are the

61
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,000
most up-to-date version on Intel's website,

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,529
then means we are good to go and we can move on to the next step.

63
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,384
Before we can fully fly backyard flyer on our drone,

64
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,649
we will need to configure PX4,

65
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,204
the autopilot that's running on board but for that,

66
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,750
we'll be using a ground control software.

67
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,139
So see you in the next video for that.
