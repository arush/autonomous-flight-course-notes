00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
Hello. My name is Sebastian Thrun.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm founder of Udacity and I'm one of the instructors in

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,265
our new Nanodegree that we called Flying Cars.

4
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:10,680
Flying cars is a bit of a misnomer.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,975
This is about drones, about anything flying.

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:15,420
But there's a nascent new industry here in

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,845
Silicon Valley and around the world that looks into

8
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:24,015
flight as a transportation medium for goods and people on a daily basis.

9
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:26,730
Now, we have the chance here at Udacity in Silicon Valley,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,710
to be at the heart of innovation.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,350
And we see things that others don't quite see yet.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,870
Ten years ago, we saw that self-driving cars would become a big topic, and guess what?

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,485
It's become the biggest topic in Silicon Valley today.

14
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,530
I predict in five years time,

15
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,865
flying vehicles will be the biggest topic in Silicon Valley innovation.

16
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:46,605
And the reason I believe is this,

17
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:49,095
transportation is a huge industry,

18
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,287
really important for people,

19
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:55,182
but the ground is very limited in transportation.

20
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,750
If we could build vehicles,

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,995
it would easy to go off vertically,

22
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,285
fly us to where we want to go, and land.

23
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:04,065
You could go faster, of course.

24
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:09,245
We could be safer because of fewer things to hit in the sky than on the ground.

25
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:13,505
And we will be environmentally more friendly and use less energy.

26
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:16,850
And the last thing is a bit of a surprise but if you look at the modern aircraft,

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,795
when a modern aircraft loses its power,

28
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:22,695
it glides down at a glide ratio of about one-to-15 or so,.

29
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:28,590
which means, the energy consumption used for lift for keeping a flying vehicle in the air

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,611
is only a 15th of the energy used to combat the air, which is what we call drag.

31
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:38,850
Now, we've built this Nanodegree to be the first in the world to teach flying cars.

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,530
There's no other place I can

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,620
imagine that would teach that material that we're teaching here.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,285
And once students graduate from this class,

35
00:01:46,285 --> 00:01:48,360
easily find a job, and can tell you,

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,660
former company Kitty Hawk,

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,880
they are desperately looking for people to hire.

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,175
And we put together a skill set and set of instructors who are world class.

39
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:58,425
This new industry is small today.

40
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,940
It's going to be big tomorrow.

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,900
Amazon, Google, and others will use drone-based systems.

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,198
Others will follow. Your pizza will fly in.

43
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:09,782
It sounds all like science fiction but the chance you get in this Nanodegree

44
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:14,980
is to really become part of that science fiction and make the future.
