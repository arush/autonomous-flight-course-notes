1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,605
We have a vision for the future.

2
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:07,975
In that flying cars,

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,730
and flight is going to be a part of

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,060
the transportation network to an even greater degree than it is already,

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,510
and there are technical challenges,

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,535
and there's a need for people trained in specific foundational concepts,

7
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:23,290
and future-looking, forward-facing concepts that people still need to know now,

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,565
in order to develop that technology.

9
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:28,060
The flying car nanodegree is Udacity's sense of what

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,765
the concepts are the people need to know in order to make flying cars a reality.

11
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,080
A lot of the development will be in the context

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,770
of a smaller scale drone because of what people have right now,

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,780
the issues are same really at every level at every size of a vehicle.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,290
This program is unique because it includes

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,435
the fundamentals about the vehicle dynamics both multirotor and fixed-wing,

16
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:54,511
but then carries this through to real practical implementation.

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:59,090
So you will implement your own controller as the major and mission planner.

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,340
The students are going to develop a variety of skills.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,480
We're going to begin very simply with just giving students

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,330
a project that shows how you command a simple drone.

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,810
How does a vehicle know where it is?

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,275
How does it execute a flight plan,

23
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,335
and how does it decide what that flight plan should be?

24
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,060
And so, the very first skill is just like,

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,585
what are the mechanics of actually getting an air vehicle under control?

26
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,980
Even if it's only in simulation,

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,140
everybody will have gone through the experience of connecting

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,945
to a UAV or a drone of some kind,

29
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,000
and putting it through its paces.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,350
We're sort of setting it up as just like a little flight in your backyard.

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,540
In fact, we're calling the project, the backyard flight.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,620
The second project the students will be looking at is 3D motion planning.

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,070
How do you generate a plan that is ideally suited for

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,438
staying as far away from buildings and other obstacles as possible?

35
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:44,159
And also, how do you set up the planning problem so

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,850
the vehicle for replanned as quickly as possible, if necessary.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,480
So we really want students to be thinking about

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,260
all these different tradeoffs as they build towards that first project.

39
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,680
So in the controls project,

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,270
students will learn to implement a flight controller from scratch,

41
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,445
that will stabilize the vehicle,

42
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:03,090
and allow the vehicle to follow a path.

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,780
Then we'll start to drill down a little bit more

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,050
into how the vehicle is actually executing those flight plans.

45
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,335
How does the vehicle know where it is?

46
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,725
How does the vehicle take in sensor data,

47
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,285
GPS, and other kinds of data,

48
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:16,150
and then construct a consistent estimate of where it is,

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,710
and what its attitude is in space?

50
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,355
For robots to understand the world, it needs sensors,

51
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:29,035
and state estimation is the field that describes how different sensor information,

52
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:33,528
and sources of information can be best combined to make sense of the world.

53
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,230
So in the state estimation project,

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,150
students will design an algorithm that uses sensor data from GPS

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,445
and IMU to estimate the position and orientation of our flying robot.

56
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:48,190
In term two, we're going to dramatically expand the scope

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,590
of technical challenges that the students are going to be thinking about.

58
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,165
We are going to really make sure that the students

59
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,895
understand some of the low-level and foundational concepts.

60
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,744
We're going to move away from the very simple drone quadrotor model.

61
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:05,230
Look at the challenges of modeling the dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft,

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,600
and a hybrid aircraft that can either go into full aerodynamic flight,

63
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,680
or go into hover, and so on and so forth.

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,290
Later on in the course,

65
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,385
we will also study how we can coordinate a whole fleet of

66
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:23,420
drones to achieve a task together such as delivering packages to customers.

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,875
To people who want to get a start in robotics,

68
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,840
or aerial robotics, frankly,

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,490
there's no better way than sitting down and starting to just implement simple things.

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,045
Having that comfort with just implementing things and trying things,

71
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:41,585
is a great foundation for coming into the Udacity Course.

72
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:44,435
There's really a tremendous amount of autonomy

73
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:47,540
and intelligence required to get us from one

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,560
off prototype demonstrations to the kind of reliability

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,050
that is going to allow a scalable, reliable, operable service.

76
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,590
My prediction for the future is that 80 percent of

77
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,590
all transportation of people and goods can be autonomous in the next 30 years.
