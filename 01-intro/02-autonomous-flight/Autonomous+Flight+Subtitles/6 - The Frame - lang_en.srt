00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,929
The frame for your quad is really just a rigid mount for the motors and electronics.

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,740
For the vast majority of quadrotor helicopters,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,185
there really isn't anything that special about the frame.

4
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:13,105
It's just the base to which everything else is connected.

5
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:16,269
The frame has to be strong enough to support the components of the vehicle,

6
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,338
yet light enough that it can be lifted along with

7
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:21,238
all the other components by the motors and propellers.

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,138
But other than that, you don't need to worry

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,274
much about aerodynamics or other complications.

10
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:28,478
That said, there are people working on

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,469
different materials and different designs for frames.

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,950
So, I don't mean to say that there aren't a lot of interesting questions to be answered,

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,359
but frankly, you can make

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,094
a perfectly serviceable quadrotor frame out of household materials.

15
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,609
There's even a company out there that sells

16
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,125
drone kits where you build the frame out of Lego.

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:49,899
The simplicity of the frame is one of the big differences between multi rotor drones and

18
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,439
other more conventional aircraft where things like

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,179
aerodynamics and structural integrity are a much bigger concern.
