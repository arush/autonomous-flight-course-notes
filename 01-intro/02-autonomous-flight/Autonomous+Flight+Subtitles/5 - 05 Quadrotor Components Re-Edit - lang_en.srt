00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
To get some intuition about how a quadrotor works,

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,205
let's build one up piece by piece.

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,310
To start with, let's take a single rotor and

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,609
attach it to a mass representing the body or frame of the vehicle.

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,899
This is the simplest possible helicopter.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,719
But what happens when the rotor spins?

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,149
In this configuration, the spinning rotor has angular momentum.

8
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,439
And through the conservation of angular momentum,

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,740
it will induce a torque on the masses attach to,

10
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,792
causing it to spin as well in the opposite direction.

11
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,614
Not a great flying machine just yet.

12
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:34,549
This is why a single rotor helicopter has a tail rotor mounted at 90 degrees to

13
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:36,500
the main propeller to exert a torque in

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,085
the opposite direction and keep the whole thing from spinning out of control.

15
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:43,730
This is the most common design of manned helicopter vehicles.

16
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,469
But, instead of a tail rotor,

17
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,119
you could introduce another propeller spinning in the opposite direction like this.

18
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,778
Now, you have a dual-prop helicopter,

19
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,755
also known as counter-rotating propellers.

20
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:58,429
And the net angular momentum from each of the rotors cancels each other out.

21
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:01,677
This is an example of a dual propeller helicopter right here.

22
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:04,099
Now, we could talk about adding a third rotor and

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,009
how you could go about balancing out the torques from three rotors.

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,109
But instead, we're going to skip over that in

25
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,370
favor of going right to the symmetric simplicity of the quadrotor.

26
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,260
Quadrotor consists of four rotors attached to a frame usually in an X shape like this.

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,700
Rotors that sit opposite from one another on the frame spin in the same direction.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
And the two pairs of motors spin in

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,560
opposite directions so that when they're all spinning at the same speed,

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,260
the vehicle can hover with a net torque of zero.

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,550
So, your basic quad now consists of a frame and four propellers.

32
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,280
You'll also need motors to drive each of the propellers,

33
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:42,570
an autopilot and flight computer to decide what the motor should do,

34
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,964
sensors like GPS, an inertial measurement unit or IMU,

35
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:48,623
a camera to observe your surroundings,

36
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:50,362
and a battery to power everything.

37
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:53,144
And with that, you have a fully functional quadrotor drone.

38
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,129
But the best way to understand how something works is to

39
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:59,369
take it apart and investigate each of the components in detail.

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,170
So that's what we'll do next.
