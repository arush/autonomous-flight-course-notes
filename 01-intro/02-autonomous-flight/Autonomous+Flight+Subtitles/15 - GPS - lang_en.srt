00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,003
Before talking about GPS, I should at least mention that with a super accurate IMU,

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:09,000
it is possible to integrate the measured accelerations to get velocities,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,990
and again, integrate those velocities to get an estimate of the position of the vehicle.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,794
But, such accurate IMUs are very heavy,

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:17,864
power hungry, and extremely expensive.

6
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:20,599
So, these are not what you'll be flying in your quadrotor.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
Instead, you'll be using the signal from

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,315
the Global Positioning System or GPS to measure your latitude and longitude as you fly.

9
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:29,070
Just like on your smartphone,

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,009
you can equip your quadrotor with a small GPS receiver like

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,158
this to get constant updates on the position of the vehicle.

12
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:38,444
As you may have noticed with your phone, however,

13
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,993
GPS sometimes gives an imperfect position estimate.

14
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,908
We've all experienced that moment when we're walking down

15
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:49,109
the street following the blue dot on our phone as it moves across the map.

16
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,350
And then suddenly, the dot jumps across the street.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,804
This isn't a problem for us walking on the sidewalk,

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,493
but for a quadrotor using GPS for position information,

19
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,899
it wouldn't know whether it's just an anomaly,

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,804
or whether a gust of wind came,

21
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,430
and actually blew the vehicle across the street.

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,255
To mitigate such problems,

23
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:09,823
other kinds of on-board sensors such as cameras,

24
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:12,765
laser rangefinders, a compass, a barometer,

25
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,195
or even the IMU itself can also be used

26
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:17,804
in order to give the vehicle a sense of where it is in space,

27
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:21,720
or whether a sudden jump in GPS position is actually valid.

28
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:25,378
For example, if the GPS position jumps 50 meters to the left,

29
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,542
but no corresponding acceleration was sense in the IMU,

30
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:31,275
you can probably assume it was a GPS anomaly.

31
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,330
Fusing all of the different sources of

32
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:36,479
sensor information is a challenge in and of itself,

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,484
which we'll get into later in the program.

34
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:40,994
But for now, and in the upcoming project,

35
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:44,130
you'll be using simulated GPS to get your position coordinates.
