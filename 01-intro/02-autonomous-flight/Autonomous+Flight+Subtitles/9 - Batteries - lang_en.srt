1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,394
The next component of your quadrotor to think about is the power supply, the battery.

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:07,184
Most quadrotors and other electric propulsion aircraft

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:10,214
use lithium polymer or LiPo batteries, like this one.

4
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:15,660
These are basically the same battery technology that's in your cell phone or your laptop.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,170
However, quadrotor batteries are a little bit different in

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,538
their design because they need to be able to discharge very quickly.

7
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:25,530
This makes them a lot more dangerous than

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,109
the batteries in your laptop or your cell phones.

9
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,780
And consequently, LiPo batteries also have to be charged very carefully.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,314
It's worth noting that in most quadrotor batteries,

11
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:38,000
there are actually multiple batteries in one.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,429
And so you have to think about making sure that

13
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,715
each cell of the battery is charged the same as the others,

14
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:47,240
so that one cell of the battery isn't discharging into another.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,445
We'll talk more about safety and balancing batteries later on in the program.

16
00:00:52,445 --> 00:00:55,460
For now, suffice it to say that in choosing a battery,

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,750
you just need to make sure it has

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,005
enough capacity to fly the kinds of missions you want to fly,

19
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:01,880
which means first and foremost,

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,483
that it has enough power to lift the vehicle and payload,

21
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,910
but also that it be able to comfortably last for the duration of the mission.
