1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,278
So, we said that the autopilot can control

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,932
the attitude of a quadrotor by controlling the motors,

3
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:07,544
but in order to know what thrust to apply to each motor,

4
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:10,515
it must first know the attitude of the vehicle as well.

5
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,570
Thankfully, there is a solution.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,750
By far and away, the most common sensor the drones used for sensing

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,740
their attitude is what's known as an inertial measurement unit or IMU.

8
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,728
Have you ever wondered what kind of magic allows your phone to

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,039
understand which way you're holding

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,644
the screen or what direction you're pointing the camera?

11
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:32,460
That magic in your phone is an IMU inside.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,825
So, the IMU is a bit of a complicated device.

13
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,780
Most IMUs consists of three gyroscopes and three accelerometers.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,865
Let's first talk about the gyros.

15
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:45,270
You could think of a gyroscope like a spinning top.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,075
In fact, here's a gyroscope right here.

17
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:53,515
Let's spin it up and mount in on our quadrotor.

18
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:57,023
You have a gyroscope inside a drone,

19
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,915
and the drone changes its attitude.

20
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,615
In this case, it turns its role of pitch.

21
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:02,905
The gyroscope maintains its orientation.

22
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:05,760
So, you can directly measure how much the drone has changed

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,793
its attitude relative to the gyro inside.

24
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:12,975
And if you have three of them spinning inside the vehicle at right angles to each other,

25
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:15,329
then you can measure how much the vehicle is moving

26
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,943
and rotating in each of those three directions.

27
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,028
So, gyroscopes are like spinning tops and they maintain

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,704
their orientation to the world over short periods of time slowly drifting.

29
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:27,699
So, they can serve as a reference over short periods of time.

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,490
The gyros inside the IMU in your drone

31
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,814
can tell you how the vehicles attitude is changing,

32
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:33,809
but we'd like to know exactly how it is

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,299
changing relative to some reference coordinate frame.

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,000
To do that, we need to have accelerometers in our IMU as well.
