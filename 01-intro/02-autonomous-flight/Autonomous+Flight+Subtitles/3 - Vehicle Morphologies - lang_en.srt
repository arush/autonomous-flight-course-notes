00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
There's a huge variety of aircraft designs that could be used to make a flying car.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,125
When most people think of flying cars,

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:10,515
they often think of literally a car with wings and propellers.

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,825
In reality, flying cars will not look like this,

5
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:14,459
but it's an interesting starting point.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,940
Real flying cars will have wings or propellers or both.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,714
Basically, they could be like normal airplanes,

8
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,739
what we call fixed-wing aircraft,

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,184
or they might look more like a helicopter,

10
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:27,644
which is often referred to as a rotary-wing aircraft.

11
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:29,640
Did you know that the rotating blades are actually

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,905
acting as wings to keep the aircraft in the air?

13
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:35,520
Fixed-wing aircraft do have a huge advantage in terms of efficiency,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,675
allowing them to go much faster and fly much further than rotary-wing aircraft.

15
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:43,469
But helicopters have a much bigger advantage for flying cars in

16
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,579
that they can take off and land vertically or what we call VTOL capability.

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,219
Remember that fixed-wing aircraft requires a runway.

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,379
Being able to take off and land vertically is

19
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,740
a huge advantage when operating in complex urban environments,

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,020
which is exactly where flying cars will be operating.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,425
Helicopters are not the only vehicles that are capable of VTOL, mind you.

22
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:03,599
There are aircraft that can rotate their propellers,

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,105
like the V-22 Osprey used by the US Marines.

24
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:07,410
There are aircraft that can vector

25
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,795
the engine thrust downwards, like the Harrier Jump Jet.

26
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:11,920
There are aircraft that have two propulsion systems,

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,329
like the F-35B with its lift fan.

28
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,899
Or aircraft that are actually designed to sit on their tail at takeoff,

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,765
and then pitch over into forward flight once they're in the air.

30
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:23,885
These aircraft have different tradeoffs in terms of stability and control.

31
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,505
And, as the Wright brothers discovered,

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,109
this tradeoff really matters.

33
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:29,299
For flying cars, the jury is still out on what

34
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,344
the best vehicle design type or morphology is going to be.

35
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:35,734
In this program, we're going to begin with a multi-rotor vehicle,

36
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,189
but in term two of the program,

37
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,519
we'll study fixed-wing aircraft as well.
