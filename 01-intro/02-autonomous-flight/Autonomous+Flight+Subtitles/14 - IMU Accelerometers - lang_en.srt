1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Gravity provides an acceleration that always tells us which way down is.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,630
And accelerometers can measure that acceleration.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,860
In an IMU, there are three accelerometers at right angles to each other,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,605
so that they can measure the acceleration in the X,

5
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:15,605
Y, and the Z directions simultaneously.

6
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:17,345
If we calibrate the accelerometers,

7
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:21,350
when we know we're experiencing acceleration only due to gravity,

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,580
like when we're sitting on the ground,

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,410
then we can use the knowledge of which way gravity is

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,250
pointing as a reference for the gyroscopes to figure out our attitude.

11
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,620
So the accelerometers give us a way to figure out which way

12
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,650
down is using gravity as a reference, and then,

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,655
we can use the gyros to figure out what the attitude of the vehicle must be,

14
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,380
even when we're accelerating in

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,340
other directions and when we no longer have a clean reference to gravity.

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,700
The original IMUs used for flight actually had

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,280
spinning tops and springs serving as the gyros and accelerometers.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,565
But now, with advances in technology,

19
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:57,460
we're able to make very small IMUs that don't have

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,870
spinning tops for gyroscopes or complicated springs for accelerometers.

21
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,690
In fact, one of the big advances in IMU technology in

22
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,535
the last 20 years is the advent of micro electro mechanical systems or MEMS,

23
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:13,450
that basically allow us to put the equivalent of three spinning tops and

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,100
three accelerometers onto a tiny chip and put it inside small consumer electronics,

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,125
like a drone autopilot or your smartphone.

26
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,874
So, now that we have the IMU that allows us to work at our attitude,

27
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:27,130
then we can use the autopilot to adjust the thrust on

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,635
the various propellers in order to move in the direction that we want.

29
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:32,410
But, how do we actually know where we

30
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,395
are or how we're making progress toward our destination?

31
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,990
Well, there are many options but the easiest way to

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,000
measure position is simply with a GPS receiver.
