1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
The autopilot is a computer that is responsible for knowing

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,564
just how much thrust to apply to each motor in order to hover,

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:09,214
pitch, roll or yod a vehicle.

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:12,070
The autopilot is responsible for adjusting that thrust in order to

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,198
level out once the vehicle is moving at a particular speed,

6
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,829
and then once it gets close to its destination to

7
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,324
pitch backwards in order to decelerate and stop.

8
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:22,285
So, we're always moving the vehicle body.

9
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:24,280
We're pitching it forward and backward,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,006
we're rolling it left and right in order to move from one place to another.

11
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,594
So how can the autopilot, a piece of electronics,

12
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,618
actually know how to control the speed of

13
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,984
the different propellers in order to achieve the desired result?

14
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:39,039
To make this happen, the autopilot first needs to know about

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,289
the current thrust vector magnitude and

16
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,149
direction and then make

17
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,923
small adjustments to the speed of each of the four spinning motors,

18
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:49,524
in order to make sure that the intended thrust vector matches what you want.

19
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:52,000
But it's not possible for the autopilot to figure

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,189
out how fast the vehicle is going or what

21
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,289
the total thrust is without actually

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,594
knowing something first about the attitude of the vehicle.

23
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,304
So, we've arrived at a conundrum.

24
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:04,299
The autopilot is required to control the vehicle attitude,

25
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,295
but in order to apply proper control,

26
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,829
it must first know the attitude of the vehicle.

27
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:11,238
So, how can the autopilot get this information?

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, that requires sensors.
