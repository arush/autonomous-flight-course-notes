1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,758
In this lesson, I'm going to start off by giving you a little bit of

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:06,849
history and the context around autonomous flying robots.

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:11,178
This program is all about flying cars which present their own set of challenges,

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,200
but autonomous flying machines are not necessarily a new thing.

5
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,838
In fact, if you've ever been on an airplane,

6
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:19,523
you've traveled inside of an autonomous flying robot.

7
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,359
So, I'll talk a little bit about the history of

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,679
flight and where we're at today on the cusp of a transportation revolution.

9
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:30,279
After that, I'll introduce the experimental platform you'll be

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,225
working with and the projects for this program, the quadrotor drone.

11
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,030
I'll go over the main components of the quadrotor and how each needs to be

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,386
selected considering the task or mission you want your drone to do.

13
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:47,554
With this bit of background on autonomous flight and basic knowledge about quadrotors,

14
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:50,450
you'll be ready to move on to the next lesson where

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,230
you'll write code to fly autonomously in a simulator.
