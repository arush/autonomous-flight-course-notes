1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Each of the motors on your quad is attached to a propeller.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,750
The thrust along each arm of

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,288
the quadrotor is a function of how fast each motor is spinning.

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:14,028
But the thrust also depends on what the properties are of the propeller you're spinning.

5
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:17,149
First off, propellers drive air in a particular direction.

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:18,333
There are either a tractor,

7
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,664
which pulls air downward through the propeller,

8
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,195
or a pusher, which pushes air upwards.

9
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,310
Can you guess which of these two configurations

10
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,574
the propellers on a quadrotor are typically in?

11
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,644
If guessed tractor, you're correct.

12
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:34,085
The four propellers on your quad pull the air downward driving the vehicle upward.

13
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,590
Propellers also have a direction of rotation.

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,210
In quadrotors, you have

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,094
two counter-clockwise rotors and

16
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:44,390
two clockwise rotors in order to allow for zero net torque.

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,923
Propellers also have a radius.

18
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:51,173
Bigger props generally can spin more slowly so they are quieter and more efficient,

19
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,713
but they also take up more room.

20
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:54,695
So, you can see that on a quadrotor,

21
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,070
given the size of your frame,

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,060
there's going to be an upper limit on the size of your propellers.

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,070
Another property for propellers is what's called pitch.

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,129
If you look at the blades of a propeller,

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,719
you'll see that they're not flat,

26
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:08,544
but they're twisted out of the plane of rotation.

27
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,109
It's that twist that we call the pitch of the propeller.

28
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,598
You can think of a propeller as a screw.

29
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,698
And if you put the propeller in some kind of

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,180
soft substance or viscous fluid as you turn the propeller,

31
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,890
it's the blades, the twisted blades that are

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,468
going to cause the propellers to move forward.

33
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,479
Similarly, the pitch of the threads on

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,810
a screw caused the screw to move forward into some substance like wood.

35
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,719
More formally, the pitch is the linear distance of

36
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,973
the propeller would move forward as the result of one rotation.

37
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:38,719
So, you can have large pitch props,

38
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:41,303
which are going to move more air per revolution,

39
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,205
or you can have low pitch props,

40
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,413
which are much flatter and they move less air per revolution.

41
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,755
Larger pitch props are generally more efficient.

42
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:52,155
And because they move more air they're what you want for large motions.

43
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,010
But at the same time they are lower thrust and so they're

44
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,600
not really what you want for hovering a heavy vehicle in the air.

45
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,338
On the other hand, props with a low pitch produce

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,015
more thrust and thus are better for hovering with a heavy load.

47
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,114
But they're also less efficient,

48
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:11,930
so you use up the battery more quickly and end up being able to fly for less time.

49
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,805
There do exist quadrotors that have

50
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:17,300
variable pitch propellers that can do

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,765
low pitch for hover and high pitch for a faster forward motion.

52
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:25,129
But variable pitch props are a lot more complicated and for our purposes here,

53
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:28,383
we'll only be considering fixed pitch propellers,

54
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,875
which is what the majority of quadrotors are flying with.

55
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,935
So, when you're picking a propeller for a vehicle,

56
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,530
you're really thinking about which flight regime you're going to be in,

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,000
or what mission you want your vehicle to accomplish.
