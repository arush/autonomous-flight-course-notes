1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,444
A chatbot serves as a really good introduction to event-driven programming

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:09,085
because a conversation really can't be programmed as a sequence of statements.

3
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:12,315
I can't just say, every good chatbot must first say this,

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:13,955
then that, then that.

5
00:00:13,955 --> 00:00:18,965
Instead, I really need to structure my program and my thinking differently.

6
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,255
I need to think about how this chatbot can respond

7
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,415
appropriately to input that I may have no control over.

8
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:26,995
So, this chatbot a code that I gave you has a structure that's

9
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:30,360
very similar to the code you'll write in the project at the end of this lesson.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,955
And I'd like to just walk through some of the important parts now.

11
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:35,480
So, in this cell,

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,248
we have this class, EventDrivenChatBot.

13
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:42,110
And I'll walk through more of the wiring and how this all works in a second.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,110
But for now, I'm just going to press shift and enter,

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,735
to execute that cell.

16
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:48,970
And now, I'm going to put my cursor in here,

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,180
and I just want to demonstrate the interface to

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,625
this chatbot that a consumer of this class might be using.

19
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:02,900
So, the first thing I want to do is instantiate it, just like this.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,860
And now, I'm going to start sending messages to

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,075
the chatbot through the handle message method.

22
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:12,745
So here, I'm going to send it a message, "hi."

23
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:14,695
I'm going to press control and enter.

24
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:17,455
And sure enough, the chatbot up says hello back.

25
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,330
Next, I'm going to do something a little more interesting,

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,030
I'm going to ask the chatbot its age.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,335
And as you can see, it actually responded with two different statements.

28
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,710
First, it said it's 38 seconds old,

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,080
and then it gave me this more precise definition of

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,300
its age with the seconds and the number of microseconds.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,620
And under the hood,

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,950
That's because there are actually

33
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,860
two callback functions which were associated with this input message, age.

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,725
Now, let's walk through the wiring to understand how this all works.

35
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,495
So I'm going to scroll up and first,

36
00:01:49,495 --> 00:01:51,230
just start with this handle message.

37
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,340
So, as you can see, it checks

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,960
this accepted messages dictionary to see if

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,285
this particular message is understood by the chatbot,

40
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,920
and if it's not, then it just apologizes and says, "I'm sorry.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,420
I don't understand," message. But let's say that doesn't happen because otherwise,

42
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,060
it first collects all of the callback functions associated with this message,

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,725
and then for each of those callback functions,

44
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:16,845
well, it just calls that method.

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,120
And so maybe, you can start to see why callback is

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,850
really an appropriate name for these sorts of functions.

47
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,310
When I said, "hi" to the chatbot and it responded, "hello"

48
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,550
that's because some callback function that prints,

49
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,180
"Hello," must have been called.

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,450
And in fact, if we scroll up,

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,725
you can see this respond to greeting function does exactly that.

52
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,320
And when I asked the chatbot its age,

53
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,160
and it responded with two messages,

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,610
well, that's because both of these functions

55
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,210
were associated with that input message, age.

56
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,360
So, let's jump up to the constructor for this class to

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,410
understand how these messages actually got wired to these functions.

58
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,660
And as you can see,

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,250
in this init method and that's just Python syntax for this is the constructor,

60
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,480
this is going to be called when you do event driven chatbot parentheses.

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,720
So, this is a constructor and you can get to see initially,

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,950
it just creates this empty dictionary of excepting messages,

63
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,640
it sets its birth time which is used in the calculation of the age,

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,650
and then all of the wiring,

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,935
all of the registering of callbacks happens down here.

66
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:27,010
And sure enough, this message age is registered to two callbacks,

67
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,383
just like we would expect,

68
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:33,415
respond to each request and the detailed version of the same function.

69
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:37,490
Now, let's just dig in to register callback so we can see what it does.

70
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,540
As you can see the doc string tells us what it does,

71
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,020
as did the function name,

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,660
but it doesn't do much that's too fancy.

73
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,495
First, to check to see if this message is actually

74
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,825
already handled by this accepted messages dictionary,

75
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:56,025
and if not, it associates a value for this message which is just an empty list.

76
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,205
We're going to populate that list with callbacks,

77
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,730
and as you can see, that's what happens here.

78
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,075
We append the newest callback onto that list.

79
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,810
Now, the reason I showed you this code is not

80
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,539
because I think it's important that you learn about chatbot.

81
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,370
It's because a chatbot provides

82
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,770
a really good intuitive understanding for why you might

83
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,650
even want to use the event-driven programming to begin with,

84
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,930
and a little later in this lesson,

85
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,415
you're going to work with some code that's very similar,

86
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:22,020
except instead of processing text from a user,

87
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,860
we're going to be processing messages from the autopilot,

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,240
and about our drone's location,

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,910
velocity, and so on.

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,000
So, let's walk through some of that code right now.
