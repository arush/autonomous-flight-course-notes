00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
Welcome back. When you first get a new drone,

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,669
you're going to want to bring it outside and get it flying.

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:08,560
And in this lesson, which we're calling Backyard Flyer,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,345
you will simulate doing exactly that.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,020
Now, to simulate this experience,

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,134
you're going to be working with the same simulator

7
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:17,304
you'll be using throughout this program.

8
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:19,545
The drone you'll be controlling in this simulator

9
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:21,870
can actually be controlled with Python code.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,865
And later, you'll be using C++ as well.

11
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:28,500
Now, the primary learning objective for this lesson is for you to understand at

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,204
a high level how this Python drone control code actually interacts with the simulator.

13
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:36,449
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,398
code in what's called an event-driven paradigm,

15
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:44,000
and that code will actually control a drone to fly in whatever flight path you choose.
