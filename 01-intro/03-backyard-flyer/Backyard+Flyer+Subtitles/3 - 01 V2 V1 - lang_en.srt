1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,213
Now, before we continue,

2
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,700
I'd like to show you what the code you're

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,355
eventually going to write is actually going to do.

4
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:11,320
And here, I have a simulator window open and it's open next to a terminal.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,845
In the actual interface you use it might actually look a little bit different,

6
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:17,185
but as you can see,

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,899
when I do an LS here,

8
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:23,259
you can see I have this file called backyard_flyer.py,

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,800
and that's the one you're going to complete at the end of this lesson.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,094
And this file actually has code which controls this drone.

11
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:38,640
So let me just run that for you now without showing you what the actual code looks like.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,340
So if I hit Enter, you can see what happens.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,470
So the drone arms,

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,134
and it takes off,

15
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,548
goes forward, turns right,

16
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,658
then it goes backwards,

17
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:56,548
and to complete square,

18
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:58,500
it slides to the left,

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,350
stops in place, and lands.

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,270
Now, this square path that

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,020
this drone flew is not the interesting thing about this project,

22
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,670
though I do think it's pretty cool to see

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,174
the drone actually flying in the square that I programmed.

24
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:14,340
What's interesting about this project is the code,

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,810
and more specifically,

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,799
the programming paradigm behind the code that allowed all of this to happen.

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,480
And that is exactly what you're going to be learning in the rest of this lesson.
