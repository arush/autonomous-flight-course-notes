1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,458
So let me show you one way you can interact with this drone with code.

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:07,319
So, I've already connected to this drone.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,169
And, now, what I want to do is call this take_control method, drone.take_control.

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,320
And I'm about to do this,

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,300
so as I do pay attention to this little button here that says manual.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,240
As you can see, taking control changes the command mode to guided.

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,853
Next, I can call drone.arm,

8
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:26,504
and before I do, pay attention to these rotors.

9
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:30,539
Because I called a drone.arm causes them to start spinning.

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,795
And, now, we're almost ready to do the really fun stuff,

11
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,090
which involves actually flying the drone.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,870
So, let's take off to an altitude of five meters.

13
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:41,463
Sure enough, the drone flies up as expected.

14
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:43,850
I can use this command position method to

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,314
actually set a target position and the drone should fly there.

16
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:56,658
And now, let me fly back to where I started.

17
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,444
All right. This is starting to make commanding the drone look pretty easy.

18
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:01,615
And in fact, it is pretty easy.

19
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:06,954
Now remember, the final project for this lesson involves making a drone fly in a square.

20
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:09,898
Well, given this command position interface,

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,850
it seems like it should be pretty easy to do that.

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,933
And in fact, I've done it down here.

23
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:17,045
Here we define the coordinates of a square,

24
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,905
or the coordinates of the corners of a square, I should say.

25
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:22,920
And if we just loop through those corners then we can just

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,180
do a drone.cmd_position star corner.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,510
Let's just run this to see if it works as expected.

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,315
Sure enough, it flies right.

29
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:34,738
Then it flies back. Now we're at 10, 10.

30
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,183
Then it flies left to 0, 10.

31
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:40,790
And back forwards to where it began at 0, 0.

32
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,160
So, great. Problem solved.

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,114
Final project over, onto the next lesson.

34
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,250
Right? Not quite.

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,599
Because there's actually a problem with structuring our drone code this way.

36
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,489
And to highlight what that problem really is,

37
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,058
I'm going to run this cell again and as I do,

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,990
I want you to now focus over here,

39
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,394
on the actual simulator,

40
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:02,289
but over here, on the code that's executing.

41
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,995
So let me run this cell. And here you see this asterisk up here,

42
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,390
and this asterisk is Jupyter Notebook's way of

43
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,069
saying this cell is currently executing code.

44
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,188
Now, the reason why I'm calling your attention to the fact that this cell is executing

45
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:22,843
code is because that means this code is all blocking code.

46
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:28,079
This drone is going to go in a square trajectory before it does anything else,

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
which is fine in a nice simulated environment.

48
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,574
But what about in the unpredictable, unknowable real world?

49
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:37,905
What if, when I execute this cell, shortly after,

50
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:42,150
another drone flew in the way of ours or something else happened?

51
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,563
The fact is, there's all sorts of unpredictable obstacles that could occur.

52
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:48,853
And when these things happen,

53
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:51,539
our drone needs to be able to respond dynamically,

54
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:56,128
and using this linear sequential style of programming just isn't going to cut it.

55
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,518
We're going to need a different way of thinking about our logic,

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,550
and that different way is called event driven program.
