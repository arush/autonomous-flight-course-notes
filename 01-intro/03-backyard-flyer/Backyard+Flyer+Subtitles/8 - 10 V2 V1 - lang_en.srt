1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
So, how do we actually use callbacks to execute a mission?

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,790
Well, when we're executing a mission,

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,920
it's important to realize that the vehicle actually

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,425
goes through a series of states or phases.

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,750
And I'm going to use the word phase here because

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,050
the word state is pretty overloaded with other meanings in this context.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,395
And in general, there are many ways you can define your phases.

8
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,510
For now, I'm going to stick with the phases used in

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,360
that upanddown.py code that you just saw.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,700
First, there's this manual phase.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,005
And in this phase,

12
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,715
the vehicle's just sitting on the ground

13
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:33,055
and it's not being controlled by the Flight Controller.

14
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:36,595
This phase ends when the arming phase begins.

15
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,980
And this is just the phase where the flight computer

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,860
takes control of the drone, and gets the rotors spinning.

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,915
This phase ends when the rotors are up to speed and the takeoff phase can begin.

18
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:50,215
Now, takeoff involves the drone going straight up

19
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:54,010
and continuing straight up until it's reached its target height.

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,165
At that point, takeoff ends and landing begins.

21
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,070
And landing, as you might expect,

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,575
is just where the drone descends back to ground level.

23
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,505
And it continues descending until it gets sufficiently close to the ground.

24
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,020
And once that happens,

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,030
the disarming phase begins,

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,815
which is just where computer control is disabled and the motors are disarmed.

27
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:18,610
Now to really understand how these phases work in our code,

28
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,200
it's important to understand the transitions that occur from one state to another.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,905
And in the code, each of these transitions is actually handled by

30
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:32,170
a particular function with names like arming transition or take-off transition.

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,450
So, the transition, for example,

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,830
from the takeoff state to

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,475
the landing state is handled by the landing transition function.

34
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,020
And in the previous video,

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,850
you saw that there were certain criteria that

36
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,460
had to be met in order for this transition to occur.

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,095
Namely, the drones height had to be greater than 95 percent of its target height.

38
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:54,190
Now, I'd like you to look through the full code for the up and down flyer class

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,915
and try to identify the criteria under which each of these states ends.

40
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,065
The real goal here is to really just read through the code and

41
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:06,265
understand how this relatively simple flight plan is actually implemented,

42
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,585
because once you've done that,

43
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,010
you'll be able to implement your own flight plan.
