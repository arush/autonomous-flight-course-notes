00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,470
To help you understand how to write code within this event-driven paradigm,

2
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:09,745
I've written a really simple flight plan in a program called upanddown.py,

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,573
and I'm going to show you that code in just a second

4
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,673
but first I want to show you what that code does,

5
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:16,089
and the name I give it away.

6
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:25,059
But if I run upanddown.py you can see the rotor starts arm,

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,585
the drone takes off,

8
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,304
flies back down and then turns off.

9
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:32,364
Now, this is a very simple flight plan but

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,905
let's take a look at the event-driven code that actually caused it to happen.

11
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:40,910
So here is upanddown.py and as you can see it's just over 100 lines of

12
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,223
code which may seem kind of verbose for

13
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:48,350
how simple it is but this verbosity actually has a reason.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,945
So let's talk about how this code works.

15
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:55,880
At the top you can see there's a lot of imports as is often the case with a Python file.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,800
We can ignore those for now.

17
00:00:57,798 --> 00:01:02,899
Likewise with this phases class we don't need to pay too much attention to it just yet,

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,810
though we will shortly and then there's this up and down

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,100
flyer class and it inherits from this drone super class.

20
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,030
This is Python notation for defining a class and saying what super class

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,079
is and this drone class is something that

22
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:18,178
we're providing for you and it's really pretty powerful.

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,220
It's got a lot of high level commands that allow you

24
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,026
to control the position of the drone,

25
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:27,689
it let's you set different way points and other sorts of high level commands like that.

26
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,428
You'll be using this class throughout the new node

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,380
but let's not worry about all that just

28
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,069
yet because for now I really want to focus on this initializer,

29
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,823
the constructor for the class.

30
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:41,460
And let me just walk through line by line really quick how this initializer works.

31
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,314
So first we call the super class initializer.

32
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,282
This is pretty standard.

33
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:50,000
Next we've got this boilerplate.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,569
This target position is going to be used by the super class to

35
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,989
navigate to different way points and also there's

36
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,039
some logic checks in

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,190
the super class drone that only begin flying if the drone is declared to be in a mission.

38
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:06,423
So we need to set this to true.

39
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:11,750
Again I want to ignore this flight face stuff for now and really

40
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,310
focus on what's similar to

41
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,074
that chat barcode you just set which is this callback registration part.

42
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:20,644
And as you can see this looks almost identical to the chat barcode.

43
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,295
We're calling a function that's called register callback.

44
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:29,814
It takes a message as first argument and then a callback function as a second argument.

45
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:33,310
So what this line of code is saying is any time we

46
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,490
get a local position update from the autopilot we want to call

47
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,790
this function local position callback and we've got something similar

48
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:43,688
going on when we get local velocity updates or state updates.

49
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:45,848
So from a high level you can see this code is

50
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,310
actually pretty similar to the chat bar since during

51
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,900
initialization we just register

52
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,468
particular callback functions to certain events or messages.

53
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:57,519
Now I'm going to peek into this local position callback in just a second.

54
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,060
But first I want you to think about when

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,878
this function is called and what it's responsible for doing.

56
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
Since I'm registering this function to this local position update,

57
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm going to be getting local position updates from the autopilot many times

58
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:14,668
a second and most of the actual way point following logic

59
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,234
is actually handled in the drone super class.

60
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:21,480
So what this function is responsible for doing is implementing any logic that's

61
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,979
particular to this particular flight plan going up and then going down.

62
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,477
Since going up requires going up until we reach a certain target altitude,

63
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,955
that's what I have to check for in this callback.

64
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,765
So let's see how that's implemented.

65
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,634
And as you can see

66
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:42,818
this flight face stuff is showing up again and this is probably starting to make

67
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,488
a little more sense now if the flight phase is

68
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,885
the takeoff phase or that's when we're performing this altitude check.

69
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:54,068
So the first thing that happens is this coordinate conversion and this is a little funny.

70
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,688
What's going on here is there are

71
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:58,628
two different coordinate systems that are trying to play

72
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:03,893
nicely together and for one of them the altitude and the z-axis goes up,

73
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:06,909
for positive and for the other one the z-axis goes down for positive.

74
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,459
So we're just making a little correction there.

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,550
And then the interesting logic happens down here where we're

76
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,060
checking to see if the altitude is greater than

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,555
95% of the target altitude and if it is we begin this landing transition.

78
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,480
And really this is sort of how we're going to think

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,960
about how flight works in this event-driven paradigm.

80
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,439
We've got these callbacks and depending on the state we're in,

81
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,399
we do some logic and then perform state transitions.

82
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,658
So hopefully this event-driven portion of the code is starting to make some sense.

83
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,230
The other thing that's important to understand about this code in which we are going

84
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,910
to be working with shortly is this idea of phases or states.

85
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,935
Once you get a sense for how these phases and these callback functions,

86
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:54,970
messages and transition functions all interact with each other you'll be able to start

87
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,995
implementing your own flight plans that

88
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,740
play nicely within this whole event-driven framework.

89
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,829
So now I'd like to look a little bit more into this phases class.
