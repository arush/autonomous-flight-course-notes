1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
Now it's time to tackle your first project.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,230
I'm joined now by my colleague, Andy,

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,960
who's here to help you get up and running. Pleasure to have you with us, Andy.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,150
Thank you, Nick. It is a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,405
In this project, you'll program a quadrotor to fly autonomously in a simulator.

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,919
The central theme of this project is a new way of thinking

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,739
about how to write programs for autonomous vehicles.

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,779
It's called event-driven programming,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,705
and you might have seen it before in other settings.

10
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:27,214
Graphical user interfaces are written as event-driven programs,

11
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:29,539
and lots of other robot systems are too.

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,450
But there are some important wrinkles in writing programs for

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,050
autonomous vehicles that need to operate for a long time,

14
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:40,885
travel long distances, and respond to all kinds of things in the outside world.

15
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:42,230
When you finish this project,

16
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,839
you'll have the foundation you need to be set up

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,570
for success in the projects throughout the rest of the program.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,979
So where are we going to start next, Andy?

19
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,484
Well, if you're not familiar with event-driven programming,

20
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:54,299
it can be a bit confusing at first.

21
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,179
So, we're going to start off by explaining the key concepts

22
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,375
behind this entirely new way of thinking about programming.

23
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,549
Next, we're going to show you how to actually

24
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,594
implement event-driven programming in Python code.

25
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:09,194
And that code will actually control your quadrotor in a simulator.

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,504
But by far the best part is,

27
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,319
once you've actually completed the project,

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,829
we're going to show you how to put that code onto a real quadcopter.

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,530
That sounds fantastic. Let's get started.
