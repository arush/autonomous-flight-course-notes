00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
When you control a drone in the way you just did using a keyboard or a remote control,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,545
you control it at a very high level.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:09,420
You tell the drone to go forward,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,365
but you don't tell it how to go forward.

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,345
For example, you don't tell it how fast to spin its rotors.

6
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,940
You leave that level of decision making to the autopilot.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,080
These high level commands that control a human operated drone,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,910
are really similar to the commands that

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,580
a flight computer would issue in an autonomous drone.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,085
And that means they're similar to the commands that you will be programming shortly.

11
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,813
Before we jump into programming an actual drone,

12
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,610
let's review how information flows in a drone.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,305
At the heart of the vehicle,

14
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:40,315
at the very lowest level, is the autopilot,

15
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:43,080
and the autopilot controls the motor speeds of

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,435
the four rotors and these rotors speed control the attitude,

17
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,565
thrust vector, and moments of the drone.

18
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,510
And generally, we do not modify the autopilot.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,815
Most of the time, you'll be writing programs that run on the flight computer,

20
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:58,665
and these are higher level programs that, for example,

21
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,900
might decide where the vehicle should go next,

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,410
and then guide the vehicle along a sequence of waypoints by properly

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,265
setting the vehicle's target position which it communicates to the autopilot.

24
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:10,920
The autopilot in turn is responsible for relaying back

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,400
crucial information like GPS measurements and data from

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,340
the onboard inertial measurement unit which includes data from

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,985
the onboard accelerometers, magnetometers, and rate gyros.

28
00:01:20,985 --> 00:01:25,270
And all of this communication happens over some sort of connection.

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,430
And in a real drone,

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,235
that might be a USB connection.

31
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,210
And in the simulator you'll be working with,

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,815
this will be some subclass of a connection class that we're providing for you.

33
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:39,105
So your job in developing software for a drone or a flying car,

34
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:43,920
is likely to be writing the programs that run up here on the flight computer.

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,470
And in this lesson, You'll get your first chance to do exactly that in our simulator.
